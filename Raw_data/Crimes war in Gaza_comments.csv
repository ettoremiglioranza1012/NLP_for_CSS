@yangliu6176,"Since World War II, the world has extended profound sympathy toward the Jewish people in light of the horrors of the Holocaust. However, that sympathy has been steadily eroded by the actions of the Israeli state, particularly in its treatment of the Palestinian population. Under the guise of self-defense, Israel has carried out military operations that have led to widespread civilian casualties, the destruction of civilian infrastructure, and long-term humanitarian crises in Gaza and the West Bank.

International humanitarian law—especially the Fourth Geneva Convention (1949)—explicitly prohibits collective punishment, targeting civilians, and the transfer of an occupying power’s population into occupied territory. Yet, Israel's continued expansion of illegal settlements, blockade of Gaza, and control over vital resources such as water and electricity reflect not merely security concerns, but an enduring strategy of territorial control and resource domination.

As noted by Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, such policies amount to apartheid and systematic oppression, and may constitute violations of Article 49(6) of the Fourth Geneva Convention and crimes under the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. In this context, what Israel claims as ""self-defense"" increasingly appears to be the legitimization of a long-term project of occupation, displacement, and dispossession, which has now exhausted the moral credit it once held in the eyes of many around the world.",2025-07-12T07:36:02Z

You also didn’t explain about the weapons that were stored underneath that school, strategically by Hamas who farms the Palestinian people like ants do aphids and then the rest of you creepy crawlies come around, sucking the rest out of them how come none of you take them home why won’t any of this surrounding Islamic countries take them into their countries? But y’all 
Just need to remember one thing not one more person would die if a mask in the Palestinian people put down their weapons so it kind of blows a hole on your theory of the high and mighty Israeli people want to take over Gosa now why would they want that ?

Lebanon use to be a majority country with majority Christians, and when they started importing refugee's from Palestine, everything changed. They were killed, displaced, and kicked out of their homes. No one has ever protested about that, no one has ever done anything about it, why should we care about some tiny small land called Palestine?

Because when I look in the eyes of every reporter or analysis of this video, I see the same people responsible for the Trans Atlantic $laavee trradee, the Indian Ocean or Black Sea $laaveee trradee- an atrocity that went on for CENTURIES. This situation is in a so called war, my people were entirely subdued- IMAGINE the atrocities with that one, and it wasn't filmed. I mean we were deemed property. Not even animals, but property. Engrained in the constitution of America 3/5ths of a person. My comment isn't about the crimes being committed in this video, because oh they are indeed crimes. It's to say- why are you surprised at your own selves? Do you not know yourself? I don't care what kind of accent you get on here and use, this has been who you are since your descendance from the caucus mountains. And YOU were never tried for your crimes. YOU never gave any repayment. Do you know how much you ruined the lives of the true Diaspora? How their lives were ruined if they lived? The mountains of lies that have been told to hide the truth and now you want to get on here and do what? Critique your own selves? These people ARE you, duh! It just goes to show how delusional you are being surprised at yourselves now that you see it on camera. That's why Isreal kicked you out from reporting there.

@jfjames20001,"I believe that the Jewish Geopolitical Entity of Zionist Israel (1948-2025), will cease to exist as Dr. Henry Kissinger, succinctly predicted, in ten years time, and that was stated in 2012, because of its own daily delegitimazition by its War Crimes committed by the IDF, and Crimes Against Humanity, committed by the Israeli Government, against the unarmed, indigenous Palestinian People and Bedouins!

There is no moral support for Israel, by the general public in the USA, today.

The only support for Israel that exists in the USA, today, is within the Amerikan Jewish Communities, and within the unstable Evangelical Christian Zionist fringe, if the TRUTH be told, indeed!

Both, AIPAC and the ZOA Organizations, are most acutely aware of this fact, for what it's worth!

Their false media polls, and savvy media control ""of the message,"" of the past +77 years, merely seeks to hide this fact from the Jewish and Gentile Communities in the USA, sadly!

Israel, must radically change its ways, in it's relationship to the USA, and the Western World, or its future is Not Guaranteed!

One must remember that the Whole World is Watching Israel, NOW!

Therefore, Continued Peaceful Global BDS Until Palestine Is Free!

For, the Global BDS Movement, remains the Only Equitable Solution that will bring about a Just Peace and Stability to Israelis and the Palestinians..., and NOT THE FLAWED ""TRUMP PEACE PLAN,"" that the Jewish Geopolitical Entity of Zionist Israel (1948-2025), so egregiously seeks to embrace!

The Israel Lobby, today, in Amerika, possesses, a  disproportionately unhealthy, institutional influence, regarding the conduct of Amerikan Foreign Policy and Domestic Socio-Political Censorship, as it has had, for many, many, many years,  sadly, indeed!

Therefore, Continued Peaceful, Non-Violent, Global BDS Until Palestine Is FREE!",2025-06-21T00:55:15Z

Was kept with artificial light (not sunlight) for many days just to mess with his mind.

That is just one thing that happens as ham@s started a war on 7/10
Doing all the worst war crimes you can imagine, also they had go pro cemara's to gather as much of jews humaliation during a surprise attack in civilians kibbutz and city of israel after innocent civilans.

The use ak47/hand grenades/RPG and more ammuination inside and towards innocent civilians in israel.

Burning them inside their home, or letting them choke from strong smoke of heavy fire.

All of these a just a pinch of ham@s WAR CRIMES IN 7/10/23

WAR CRIMES SHOULD BE ANSWERED ONLY WITH WAR CRIMES.

Jewish people, Rabbis, Holocaust survivors and descendants of Holocaust survivors have been trying to warn the world about the evil that is zeonist/zeonism for a very long time and still are. 

Given zeonists had signed agreements with the naazis in ww2 (see haavara agreement and Lehy to start with) its not surprising that zeonist israel is behaving just as viciously and inhumanely as the naazis did in ww2 that zeonists collaborated with. zeonists provided lists of names to the naazis so zeonists weren't accidentally rounded up and put on trains to the death camps. 

zeonists/zeonist israel are the naazis of todays world and should be treated just like the naazis were after ww2 = pariahs and war criminals and prosecuted for their war crimes. 

 Evidence will b3 easy to gather as zeonist israeli itf thugs proudly posted, and keep posting,   their war crimes on tic tok and other social media and government officials/ministers made  public statements/announcements of what they intended to do and did do.",2025-03-22T23:56:41Z

Good thing now Israel had enough n they now realise no peace will ever come with these terrorist mindset. Israel never start war only to defend itself they had to send their children to war. If only the PA will accept the land is not theirs that's it's Jewish homeland n stop brainwashing their kids to grow in hate. Wasted money the PA use for rockets tunnels and ammunitions instead of improving lives of the people. The world knows Israel is JEWISH HOME.

The same broadcaster that tried to pour scorn on the ICJ gen o cide ruling and tried to hide that judgement in the fog of malicious lies about UNRWA the day after that ICJ ruling. Further, more recently, tried to halve the official death toll, when authoritative sources such as the Lancet, WHO and UNICEF advised us to understand it will be much larger.

@jamesbarnes3832,"It doesn't make any difference is Israel is part of the ICC or not.
The State of Palestine is part of the iCC add the crimes that the ICC are investigating are in the State of Palestine.
I really don't care if your country acknowledges the State of Palestine as a country or not.
Over 75% of the member states of the UN acknowledge the State of Palestine is a country and so does the ICC.
It is time for that less than 25% of the countries in the world to wake up to the reality that the State of Palestine has existed for decades and that supporting racists isn't beneficial to world peace.
And, yes, Zionist do claim that they are racially superior to Palestinians. That is the whole reason that they feel that they have the right to take what they believe belongs to them due to their race alone. Zionists are Jewish Supremacists. They are invading another country. They did invade the Palestine Mandate. They are racists.
I'm an American and the US government is full of racists that support these racists simply due to their race. They even go so far as to call those that point out the racism of Zionists for being racist. You are not racists if you are pointing out racism.
Not all Jews - even in Israel - are Zionists. But all Zionists - no matter where they are in the world - are racists.
If you side with racists, then you are a racist.",2025-02-06T09:32:05Z

@farid7000,"You forgot to mention that Ham/ass exaggerated the number of the victims, often including its members as civilians. 
There were multiple reports on this, but here’s one:

The scale of civilian deaths in Gaza is a key element in a legal and propaganda push attempt by Israel’s enemies to isolate it internationally using false allegations of genocide.

The figure, which does not distinguish between civilians and the 17,000 terrorists Israel says it has killed in Gaza, also includes about 5,000 people who die of natural causes each year, states the report.

“This report raises serious concerns that the Gaza MoH figures have been overstated,” wrote Andrew Fox, an analyst who specializes in defense, the Middle East and disinformation, who wrote the report for the Henry Jackson Society.

“The data behind their figures contains natural deaths, deaths from before this conflict began and deaths of those killed by Hamas itself; it contains no mention of Hamas combatant fatalities; and it overstates the number of women and children killed,” reads the report, titled “Questionable Counting: Analysing the Death Toll from the Hamas-Run Ministry of Health in Gaza.”",2025-02-05T19:43:24Z
@TonnyTK100,"So the BBC is telling me that 120 countries, representing approximately 7.4 billion people, are in favour of the arrest of Netanyahu by the ICJ, while only 12 countries, representing around 820 million people, are against it. Doesn’t that make you wonder why there’s such a massive difference between those who are in favour of the ICJ ruling against Netanyahu and those who aren’t? Doesn’t it suggest that the majority of people and international organisations might have a point? Why does the majority have to be wrong, and the minority right?",2025-02-05T19:42:03Z

@eatmyshorts7973,"Based on recent reports, Ehud Olmert, the former Israeli Prime Minister, does not appear to be widely loved or supported in Israel currently. 
Here's a breakdown of public opinion surrounding him:
Low popularity: Several articles from 2007 indicate his approval ratings were extremely low, with some polls suggesting a plurality of Israelis considered him the ""worst PM ever"".
Criticism of current government: Olmert has been a vocal critic of the current Israeli government's policies, particularly regarding the war in Gaza, and this has drawn criticism from some within Israel who believe his legal record undermines his credibility.
Corruption scandals: His conviction on corruption charges and subsequent prison sentence have significantly damaged his public image and political standing. 
However, it's important to note:
Recognition of his past service: Some still acknowledge his experience and record as prime minister, particularly regarding security matters.
Some support for his views: He still has supporters who agree with his criticisms of the current government's approach.
Focus on the present: While public opinion polls regarding Olmert specifically may not be readily available for 2025, his current relevance and perceived popularity are likely tied to his public commentary on current political events, particularly the war in Gaza.",2025-06-27T18:55:13Z

@Soppygangster,"As an academic working in one of the world’s leading medical research institutions—situated in Jerusalem, a city sacred to all three Abrahamic faiths—I offer this perspective with both scientific clarity and moral seriousness:

Why have neither the United Kingdom nor the Palestinian health authorities meaningfully implemented medical cannabis into their national healthcare systems, particularly in pediatric oncology?

This question is not rhetorical. In Israel, medical cannabis has been a regulated therapeutic option for over three decades. Since the early 1990s, Israel has maintained a pioneering position in cannabis science and application, thanks in large part to the foundational research of Prof. Raphael Mechoulam, who first isolated THC and identified the endocannabinoid system—a discovery that revolutionized neuroimmunology and pain science.

> 📚 *Mechoulam, R., & Gaoni, Y. (1964). “The structure of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol.” Journal of the American Chemical Society.



Israel’s Ministry of Health Medical Cannabis Unit (Yakar) oversees a national framework that provides cannabis to patients suffering from treatment-resistant conditions, including children with cancer. Clinical studies and real-world data have shown that cannabis can significantly reduce chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), chronic neuropathic pain, and cachexia (wasting syndrome)—often more safely and effectively than synthetic alternatives.

> 📚 *Bar-Lev Schleider et al. (2018). “Prospective analysis of safety and efficacy of medical cannabis in large pediatric cohort.” Nature Scientific Reports.



Meanwhile, in the United Kingdom, despite legal reforms in 2018 permitting certain cannabis-based products for medicinal use, access remains practically non-existent within the NHS framework. As of 2022, fewer than five prescriptions had been issued for unlicensed cannabis-based medications through NHS providers.

> 📚 House of Commons Health and Social Care Committee (2019); NHS England Cannabis-based products for medicinal use, Policy Statement.



In Palestinian territories, where the medical system struggles under political and infrastructural strain, the issue is not legal obstruction alone—it is the absence of political will, regulatory foresight, and ethical prioritization of non-conventional but effective treatments.

Now, allow me to interject a moral and theological observation. In Israel, this approach is not only scientific—it is rooted in our ethical framework. The Jewish concept of Tikkun Olam—“repairing the world”—compels us to pursue healing not only for ourselves, but for humanity. One need not be religious to appreciate that in Genesis 1:29, it is written:

> “Behold, I have given you every seed-bearing plant... it shall be yours for food.”
Many Jewish ethicists, rabbis, and clinicians interpret this as a divine license to use nature for healing—especially when human suffering is at stake.



So, I must now pose five questions which I respectfully submit for serious ethical and clinical reflection:

1. If medical cannabis demonstrably eases the pain of terminally ill children, what scientific or ethical justification remains to prohibit its access?


2. Why are outdated drug classifications and political stigma still permitted to override empirical evidence and patient well-being?


3. At what point does the failure to act become an act of neglect—particularly when vulnerable pediatric patients are involved?


4. If Israel—a nation under continuous geopolitical and internal tension—can implement a compassionate, evidence-based cannabis program, why not more stable or equally burdened health systems?


5. And when future generations examine this era, what will history say you did when the choice was between suffering and relief, between dogma and science?



We often hear the phrase “war on cancer.” But I ask: Is there truly a war on cancer—or just a war on change, a resistance to botanical therapeutics, and a chronic refusal to disrupt outdated pharmaceutical monopolies?

And with the deepest respect, let me end with a question that demands moral clarity:

Who is killing the children now?
Is it the disease alone—or the systemic inaction, the legal inertia, and the medical fear that allows preventable suffering to persist?

@MskellyBaby-cn1bz,"Zionist Militias Responsible for Foundational Terrorism (Pre-1948)

Before the State of Israel was declared, several Zionist paramilitary groups operated in Mandatory Palestine. These groups used terrorism, assassinations, and mass violence to drive out both British colonial forces and the indigenous Palestinian Arab population. Their tactics were condemned at the time by many—including international observers, Jewish intellectuals, and anti-colonial movements.

1. Irgun (Etzel)
Founded in 1931, Irgun was a right-wing Zionist militia that broke away from the Haganah. It carried out a wide campaign of bombings and killings targeting Palestinian civilians and British officials. Irgun’s actions were deliberately aimed at spreading fear and destabilizing British rule to pave the way for a Jewish state.

2. Lehi (Stern Gang)
Formed in 1940 by Avraham Stern, Lehi split from Irgun over disagreements about fighting the British during WWII. It was unapologetically militant and engaged in targeted assassinations, bombings, and attacks on civilian populations. It operated with a clear strategy of state-building through terror.

3. Haganah
While originally a defensive militia, the Haganah later developed its own offensive capabilities and collaborated with Irgun and Lehi in key operations. After 1948, Haganah became the backbone of the official Israeli military—the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).
Documented Acts of Terrorism and Ethnic Violence (1937–1948)

→ 1937–1939: Irgun bombing campaigns
During the Arab Revolt, Irgun carried out mass bombings of marketplaces and civilian areas. One bombing in Haifa in 1938 killed over 21 Palestinian civilians. These attacks were indiscriminate and intended to sow terror.

→ 1944: Assassination of Lord Moyne
Lehi assassinated British Minister of State for the Middle East, Lord Moyne, in Cairo. This was condemned by Winston Churchill and further highlighted Lehi’s disregard for diplomacy or human life.

→ 1946: King David Hotel Bombing
Irgun planted bombs in the King David Hotel in Jerusalem, targeting the British administrative headquarters. The blast killed 91 people: 41 Arabs, 28 British, 17 Jews, and 5 others. It remains one of the deadliest acts of terrorism in the region’s history.

→ 1947: Shubaki Family Execution
Lehi executed five members of the Palestinian Shubaki family, falsely accusing them of informing the British. This was part of a pattern of extrajudicial killings meant to terrorize local Palestinians.

→ 1948: Deir Yassin Massacre
Irgun and Lehi jointly attacked the village of Deir Yassin near Jerusalem. Over 100 civilians were killed, including women and children. The massacre spread panic and directly contributed to the mass exodus of Palestinians in what would become known as the Nakba.
The Aftermath: From Terror to Statehood

After the declaration of Israel in 1948, the militias responsible for these atrocities were not held accountable. Instead, their leaders became part of the new state’s political and military institutions. Men like Menachem Begin (Irgun) and Yitzhak Shamir (Lehi) went on to become Israeli Prime Ministers.

The IDF inherited not only the personnel but the operational doctrine of these militias—shaped by ethnic violence, forced displacement, and normalization of civilian targeting.",2025-06-04T03:51:20Z

Among these are the duty to respect the self-determination of peoples (including the Palestinians), the duty to respect human rights, and the duty to refrain from the use of force against other states (where not authorized by the Security Council). Israel, for the 76 years of its existence, has been repeatedly in breach of these principles. 

A temporary exception to the prohibition on the use of force is codified in Article 51 of the UN Charter for self-defense from external attacks. But importantly, no such right exists where the threat emanates from inside the territory controlled by the state. This principle was affirmed by the World Court in its 2004 opinion on Israel’s apartheid wall. And the Court found then, and again in its 2024 opinion on the occupation, that Israel is the occupying power across the occupied Palestinian territory. Thus, Israel, as the occupying power, cannot claim self-defense as a justification for launching military attacks in Gaza, the West Bank, East Jerusalem, or the Golan Heights.

Israel's killing rate in Gaza exceeds Pol Pot's genocidal annual killing rate. Please read the genocide expert's article, ""The Lancet and Genocide 'by Slow Death' in Gaza"", published in July 2024: the expert was Ohio State University's Moritz Law School Professor Emeritus John B. Quigley, who has also written a 2005 book: “The Case for Palestine: An International Law Perspective"": A Duke University Press's concise summation: ""Quigley attributes the breakdown of negotiations in 2000 to Israel’s unwillingness to negotiate on the basis of principles of justice and law.""

The prestigious medical journal, The Lancet in early July 2024 reported Israel had killed and estimated ""186,000"" Gazans in less than 9 months, about 21,000 per month, 252,000 annualized. For every Gazan killed violently (55,000 dead counted, another 15,000 missing, presumed dead under rubble, current July 2025 estimates) then The Lancet conservatively estimated that 4X more are dead primarily due to a lack of medical care. TOTAL, using The Lancet's metrics, Israel now has killed about 350,000 Gazans. Israel killed 1,400 medical workers, arrested thousands of medical workers, damaged all hospitals, destroyed most hospitals, and destroyed the medical, sanitary and water systems. How many do you sane, moral, informed persons estimate Israel has killed? How many more will die due to lack of medical care and malnutrition. Pediatricians know that malnutrition in children, even for short times, cause irreversible lifelong cognitive decline.

Also, Professor Dannenbaum declaring March through May 2024 were relatively less harmful by malnutrition, apparently missed this: Human Rights Watch, on April 9, 2024, confirmed, “Gaza’s Health Ministry reported as of April 1 that 32 people including 27 children had died of malnutrition at hospitals in northern Gaza. Save the Children confirmed the deaths from starvation and disease of 27 children.”  For 17 years prior to October 2023, Professors Finkelstein, Pappe, Khalidi, Quigley and others described the severe sadistic siege imposed by Israel's terrorist IDF.

@GaryAskwith1in5,When Israel had to revise their account about the 15 medics they shot & buried in a shallow mass grave with vehicles it reminded me of another incident where a mass grave was found near a hospital in Gaza where Palestinians were shot point blank earlier on in the war but I wasn’t able to find the story. I wondered if there was anyone archiving that specific thing ie all the incidents where Israel have had to revise their lies because they failed to destroy evidence. Then another archive of all their reports or investigations they have done in which we have to trust their word. You could then make a case that where investigation outcomes do not have actual evidence that we should assume that all of those reports are lies. So White House briefings that say we are waiting for Israel’s investigation outcomes could be challenged as BS & a UN investigation could be demanded. Then again Israel would just refuse independent investigations and that’s how they carry out genocide with impunity.

If Gaza's ppl want a future, they need to oust Hamas.

@WaterMelonCrimesDotCom,"In regards to Palestine, It is critical that we meticulously document every event, atrocity, statement, tweet, action, violation, double standard, lie, news coverage/headline/report, any statements influencers/celebs (like Jared Kushner/Dr Phil/Van Jones/Ben Shapiro/Patrick Bet-David/Jordan Peterson/Donald Trump jr/Peter Thiel/Justin Bieber statements they’ve made/tweets) and war crime on a dedicated website in regards to Palestine, show everything happening in Gaza and the West Bank by the IDF. Something like a time capsule/archive/database site/online museum where we show as much proof as possible. We need an alternative to social media and mainstream news (both which is heavily censored and will continue to be). Not everyone gets information the same way (still many rely on msm/news headlines/social media). We need a platform that can’t be censored and where we can show all the truth unfiltered. People need to see the atrocities. Tracking every IDF power tripping/committing war crimes clips, every Israeli/American politician statement/quote/tweet/action (ex. John Fetterman/Brian Mast/as many as we can find/Why Trump pardoned Aviem Sella and Pollard/every AIPAC politician). ALL OF IT. Before and after October. We can't afford to underestimate how much people don't know, are unaware or understand about these issues and there’s so much context we might be missing to see, so better to organize all of it– we need to preserve a comprehensive record of as much proof as possible. We can’t afford Iraq/Afghanistan war like ignorance anymore, we have to spread as much awareness as we can. Please save everything you find, encourage others to as well. Social media will be censored soon. Even encouraging people to save everything they find will go a long way. Make your own post like this! Lets make this  a BDS like movement! Please keep waking people up, show and save any proof you find, encourage others to do that same and keep spreading awareness!!!!!

@benenivel1478,"Apparently the journalists CHOSE to ignore a very important information: are the places in area A, B or C (I checked they are all in C and this is why you have Israeli police and army coming and going). 
It is incredible that they simply do not talk about this. Oslo Accords are the agreement that govern all of these places. You can't go and film things and consider that Arab settlers should be considered as legal owners in area C.

Arabs are not supposed to build anything there, but Arabs being Arabs will build settlements and call them ""villages"", bring in sheep and then be surprised that things do not go so well for them.
This is total bullshit, Mu'Arrajat was an illegal settlement from the ARABS (they can't do this in area C without proper permit). Amazing to see that the EU countries fund this illegal activity, what a waste of money. For some reason ""settlers"" only applies to Jews (nevermind that Jews were always present in these parts for millennia). Arabs also ""settle"".
I checked the maps and indeed Mu'Arrajat is in area C: they are not to be settled by Arabs. This is why they are getting problems.",2025-07-14T23:27:18Z

The soldiers indeed are happy when they blast things, but they follow orders coming from the top, adhering to international laws. No war crimes here either.

Even if there was a war crime committed, it doesn't mean that it is performed methodologically, or to a big extent.

@p.6969,"Dall'inizio della guerra in Israele una nuova opinionista (molto amata dalla sinistra) spopola nelle televisioni nazionali, il suo nome è Francesca Albanese ed è «relatrice speciale sulla situazione dei diritti umani nei territori palestinesi occupati dal 1967» delle Nazioni Unite.

La Albanese si presenta come un «esperto indipendente» sulla situazione israelo-palestinese e, svolgendo un incarico per le Nazioni Unite, teoricamente dovrebbe avere posizioni equilibrate e super partes ma in realtà, ascoltando i suoi interventi, emerge una visione apertamente filo-palestinese e anti-israeliana. Per fare solo qualche esempio, pochi giorni fa dichiarava: «Israele occupa come una dittatura militare» e «la risposta militare non serve a niente», non proprio dichiarazioni imparziali. Infatti imparziale la Albanese non sembra esserlo come emerge da un report del 2022 di Unwatch intitolato emblematicamente «Mandate to discriminate». Unwatch è un'organizzazione non governativa che analizza e monitora l'attività delle Nazione Unite e ha scoperto una grave omissione nel modulo dei conflitti di interesse presentato dalla Albanese nella sua candidatura all'Un. A quanto si apprende non avrebbe infatti dichiarato che suo marito, Massimiliano Calì, ha lavorato per il ministero dell'economia dell'Autorità Nazionale Palestinese.

Come spiega il giornalista Antonino Monteleone su X: «Nel suo modulo di domanda all'Onu, a pagina 14, ad Albanese è stato chiesto se esistessero rapporti personali o finanziari che avrebbero potuto indurre la candidata a limitare la portata delle indagini, a limitare la divulgazione o a indebolire o distorcere in qualsiasi modo i risultati; su eventuali fattori che possano direttamente o indirettamente influenzare o comunque pregiudicare la capacità del candidato di agire in autonomia nell'adempimento del mandato; e a proposito di qualsiasi motivo, attuale o passato, che possa mettere in dubbio l'autorità morale e la credibilità del candidato. A tutti questi, lei ha risposto: No». Eppure il ruolo di suo marito Massimiliano Calì era tutt'altro che marginale svolgendo l'incarico di consigliere economico del ministero dell'Economia Nazionale dello Stato di Palestina a Ramallah. Proprio in questa veste, lavorando per il governo del presidente palestinese Mahmoud Abbas, il marito di Albanese ha scritto un rapporto intitolato: «I costi economici dell'occupazione israeliana per i territori palestinesi occupati».

Il report di Unwatch sottolinea come Francesca Albanese abbia preso una serie di posizioni pubbliche che «lascerebbero dubitare dell'assenza di pregiudizi nei confronti di Israele». Emblematica in tal senso una recente intervista al Palestine Chronicle in cui la collaboratrice delle Nazioni Unite ha attaccato l'esistenza di Israele sostenendo che lo Stato ebraico è «in violazione di lunga data dei principi fondamentali del diritto internazionale, iniziato 70 anni fa con lo spopolamento forzato di due terzi del territorio popolazione araba indigena in quello che divenne lo Stato di Israele nella Palestina sotto mandato britannico».",2025-07-14T06:28:27Z

@Ana-Maria-r3z,"Judaism as a religion makes what sense? Americanism as a religion makes what sense? Frenchism as a religion makes what sense? Britishism or Germanism as a religion makes what sense?
Judeans are the blessed by The Almighty God descendants of Juda. It is all about biblical genealogy and rights of inheritance. What we see is all political and ideological manipulations and racist dictatorship for power and money?? 
A cult/religion according to Moses ' laws, or according to The Old Testament laws would make indeed sense!
Israel' state leaders and part of its actual population have no respect for the 10 commandments! They only use luciferian gnostic ideology and wrongly, out of the context biblical quotations,  sinning against The Holy Spirit of God, in order to promote terrible crimes against humanity!

Is hama$ itself a mo$$ad creation in order to have reasons to destroy Palestinians??? How many true biblical Israelis are among the so called Palestinians? Who are the zionists??
Is the Syrian terrorist occupation more or less the same scenario with more or less the same purpose?? (money&power&genocidal satanic eugenism)
It is about the satanist-gnostic japhethite chasarians (=ashchenaz population=red russians=huns=xiangnu population)-edomite mafia 
( the ""elites"" of Gog of the land of Magog(chasarian caganate) + Edom) (Revelation 2.9 and 3.9) leading and having invaded Israel and most of the still so called ""democratic"" and ""civilised"" western and european in general + northern american countries. Absolutely nothing in common with the Biblical, spiritual or natural, Israel, excepting for the lying rethoric of some ignorant and/or dishonest political and religious gnostic idolaters in disguise figures. 
Many of the turcs and part of the hungarians are of chazarian origin.

It is all about a satanist criminal ""elite"" and not at all an ethnic or racist approach!!!

An anarchist communist, Max Goldstein, leader of an anarchist terrorist communist group of chasarians (huns=ashchenaz(grand-son of Japheth-(Genesis 10)) population=xiangnu population =red russians) placed  a bomb in the Romanian Senate in 1920 and killed the minister of Justice, Dimitrie Greceanu, dececed in hospital, the  senators Demetriu Radu (greek-catholic bishop of Oradea Mare, instantly killed) and Spirea Gheorghiu (dececed in hospital). Among the others severely injured was the president of the Romanian Senat, veteran, artilery general Constantin Coandă, who was the father of Henry Coanda, the inventor of reaction planes. The general Constantin Coanda had sold his property in order to finance the research of his son.
It is their custom to first identify, destroy and replace the elite of the country they want to take control and possession of. Now this is global.
In the years 1950-1960, the chasarian Boris Grunberg, alias Alexandru Nicholschi, soviet spy and general in the political police in the occupied Romania, lead one of the most antihuman torture brain-washing experiment in the Pitesti political prison, where christians, many students, under the most horrific tortures, where forced to celebrate the ""mass"" with feces and urine. Not many survived that genocide!
These criminals satanists chazarian-edomite mafia monsters are not humans, they are reptilians, nephilims!?
 It is all about a new global terrorist invasion done by the huns, nazis-communist (their creation))-type, with absolutely no biblical rights over the Biblical Israel or any other country in the world, except the ones where they are legally citizens of and where they are obliged to respect natural, moral and the respective laws, respecting in loyalty the population. A terrorist criminal invading state leadership or organisation has no legal right to exist.
Nurnberg trials for them!!!
According to my informations, chasarians==turco-huns=xiangnu/ashchenaz population=red russians originate from the proximity of China, being defeated and driven away by the Chinese Han dinasty in the first two centuries and then by the Vikings. They had established a new state in the region of the actual European war, state destroyed after being defeated by prince Sviatoslav of Kiev in the X-th century. They want now to reestablish it as the center, in unity with the occupied by them Israel, of an European and then a global empire. They have spread terror and abuse, in alliance also with the ottoman Empire, all along Europe for centuries. They have infiltrated all the financial systems and most of border control. They have the capacity and custom to steal identity and main institutions, by infiltration. They use very efficiently Sun Tzu methods of war. The genocide, motivated on eugenic, of course anti-scientific theory, is in fact a ritual of human sacrifices to satan their master. This satanist shamanic elite represent biblically Gog of the land of Magog and they are in alliance, since aprox. VII-VIII-th century, with gnostic luciferian self idolaters edomite rabbinic sects. They use this fact to, in a fraudulent way,  declare  themselves as ""israelis"". See Revelation 2.9 and 3.9 and Genesis 10, about Ashchenaz beeing grand-son of Japheth, not Sem! They are not semites! According to the biblical prophecies this pseudo-""elite"" will be completely destroyed. 
 Jesus Christ is The Lord!

As far as the West (USA included) and the decent normal chazarians themselves, does/do not reject the authority of the gnostic-satanist chazaro-edomite mafia (their link with Biblical Israel can be found in Revelation 2.9 and 3.9), controlling all 7 mountains of the society, and the West with all Europe (now in EU imposed and generated autoimmune disease ) included does not return to its true Christian roots and mutual respectful solidarity, the disaster is inevitably and dramatically coming! (Biblical referrences: Gensis 10, Ezekiel 38, 39, Daniel 2, Obadiah, Revelation 2.9and 3.9, Revelation 16,19, ....)

I have not heard so much BS in a long while. You are NOT allowed to pick a military target by the mindset ""I'll kill 3 civilians but 5 enemies, ok I'll carry out the attack""

This just proves how inhumane Israel is. Get out of Gaza, the Westbank now. And lets not forget Syria that Israel just invaded for no reason - another warcrime btw.

Israel keep others - doesn't Israel have a right to exist? We are getting to the point that you could easily say no at this point. No country that targets civilians, commit warcrimes and mass-murder and invasions again and again.",2024-12-31T06:32:09Z

5.) Is Israel arresting children with just cause?
6.) Are People without evidence being tortured in Israeli Prisons? Some as young as 7
7.) No media allowed so the crimes can be hidden! It’s tooo far gone 
8.) The Killing of Hind Rajab a 6 yr old child and the service men was a war crime !
9) Resistance of your occupation isn’t a war crime! I would direct you to the French Resistance of WW2
10.) Withholding food/water/Targeting Hospitals and Places of Worship and schools is a war crime !

@michaelrunk5930,"Lol yes their absolutely is evidence that israel committing genocide. I can show more then enough evidence prove Israel is committing at least three of the five acts of Genocide.

Case in point. The first act of genocide is killing members of the group. This is talking about civilians not enemy combatants. It also doesnt matter so much how many are killed as much as its about intent. You have to prove intent.

There are crap loads of videos that prove intent. The biggest one is from Netanyahu. On Air he makes a comment quoting a passage from the torah about Amalak and killing all of them men women children and donkey. He made this on connection to Gazs. That is a genocide comment.

You have numerous members of thr Knesset talking about wipe out all of the Palestine. Leveling the entite to the ground. Driving the Palestine in to the see. Hell you had one who flat out suggested they should nuke Gaza. 

You have high ranking members if the military make similar comments. Then you have IDF soldiers mocking the pain and suffering and death of the Palestine people. Showing disregarding the loss of life. You have videos of IDF soldiers saying they are gone kill all the Palestine and leveel Gaza to the ground. Or wipe it out till nothing left.

All of this shows intent by Netanyahu, members of Knesset, high ranking military officers all the way down to the foot aoldiers. Any one with youtube can find these videos. 

Thus Israel is killing members of the group. You only need to prove 1 of the 5 acts.",2024-03-01T04:31:43Z

Iran missed out on that opportunity during the 12 day war because it was not prepared when it should have prepared militarily to go all in and free Palestinians.

Subjecting starving children to military drone attacks that dismember and shatter fragile bodies leaving children maimed and suffering without relief of medical treatment is the most heinous of crimes. This is not Christs teaching it is not justifiable in any measure those permitting such an aberration are complicit in a crime being perpetrated against innocent children.

Broke the walls down then the buildings. From that he learned how to fortified his own cities and ensure water and food . Unfortunately today's evil leaders believe that it is okay to commit genocide and scorched earth policies. The people who voted them in thought 💭 without understanding what was being said. Got caught in the fakeness of 'we the people' words. When lies are told every day in schools and work places it seems true. Very few bother to ask questions and search of honesty.
 Once the toxic people have acquired power and money they control all and destroy those who opposed.

@yomiraim8045,Marwan you seems a bit disappointed. Well put the blame on hamas. Advise hamas to end the war. Trll them to accept ceasefire proposal. Hamas can end the war today and save lives and properties. The international communities will not send soldiers to gight Israel. No arab countries will do that. So it is not a new thing to say the EU and Arabs ate hypocrites. Qatar is the president of the hypocrites. Put the blame where it rightly belong. No one can help stop the war hamas started. Blame hamas for starting what they cannot end or contain. Stop blaming all for hamas brutal attack on October 7 2023. What do you want the EU to do? To destroy their own public peace for hamas senseless attack on October 7 2023? Is it not enough for almost everyday protest in EU while the Arabs countries like qatar who sponsor terrorism are enjoying peaceful days? Marwan blame hamas for their senseless attack. You cam imagine hams still planning to kidnap more hostages and yet you are here blaming the EU and international community.  Hamas is not ready for ceasefire and you should stop soliciting for hamas.,2025-07-13T13:33:56Z

@sourcetext,"Book of Joshua ,
Research needed.

🛑The Book of Joshua,who changed it, and why? 
Author: The Book of Joshua does not explicitly name its author. More than likely Joshua the son of Nun, the successor of Moses as leader over Israel, penned much of this book. 

 🛑Note *  The latter part of the book was written by at least one other person after the death of Joshua. It is also possible that several sections were edited / compiled following Joshua’s death. Full article: Who wrote the  of Josh ? Who was the author of Joshua?

🛑Date of Writing: The Book of Joshua was likely written between 1400 and 1370 B.C. Full Article: When was Joshua written?

   🛑 Purpose of Writing: The Book of Joshua provides an overview of the military campaigns to conquer the land area that God had promised. Following the exodus from Egypt and the subsequent forty years of the wilderness wanderings, the newly-formed nation is now poised to enter the Promised Land, conquer the inhabitants, and occupy the territory. The overview that we have here gives abbreviated and selective details of many of the battles and the manner in which the land was not only conquered, but how it was divided into tribal areas.

🛑Key Verses:Joshua 1:6-9, ""Be strong and courageous, because you will lead these people to inherit the land I swore to their forefathers to give them. Be strong and very courageous. Be careful to obey all the law my servant Moses gave you; do not turn from it to the right or to the left, that you may be successful wherever you go. Do not let this Book of the Law depart from your mouth; meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do everything written in it. Then you will be prosperous and successful. Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be terrified; do not be discouraged, for the LORD your God will be with you wherever you go.""

🛑This does not appear to be written by a person in the state of 
Deveikut (דְּבֵיקוּת): This Hebrew term, meaning ""cleaving"" or ""adherence"", refers to the aspiration of a mystic to achieve a state of intense spiritual closeness and communion with God. It's about transcending the self and connecting with the divine presence through practices like meditation, prayer, and contemplation.
For what it's worth .

@TheraP2014,"I read this yesterday 4/29/24. Excerpt:
""A new bill is being introduced in the U.S. Congress that would install actual ""thought police"" monitors across U.S. colleges and universities, to secretly spy on students and faculty to make sure no one supports freedom for Palestine.

Anyone supporting Palestine will be expelled or arrested, and new government FISA spying powers will be used to secretly spy on all the private communications of targeted individuals. This is all being done at the demands of Israel and the ADL, in order to insulate Israel from any criticism across the United States.

To appease the Zionist in other words, the U.S. is about to be transformed into an Orwellian hellzone.""

Most of my comments are shadowbanned; regrettably I cannot post the link for the article. Not even my ""automatic"" spell checker works on utube. Btw Trump supporters:  only candidates that support Israel will be installed for president, VP,  and so on.

@NK-xw8ok,"The crimes of Israel sound to me a lot like that of the holocaust! 
There are far more Palestinians murdered by Israel than publicly acknowledged! 
Israel has inflicted such enormous damages , so the number of those they murder and are those they have slaughtered are  unaccounted for! 
They have bombed and bombed so many dwellings .bringing down so much of the infrastructure making it , and leaving it impossible to account for the dead ! 
I’m positive that the number of Palestinians murdered are well beyond that of 40,000 lives that is currently being claimed and expressed publicly by the many news outlets around the world !  
The number of dead Palestinians Israel has exterminated has easily surpassed 100,000 ! 
Knowing the world vowed to “ never again”  just sit by and allow for the extermination of human life , was simply a lie! 
As we can see that There are far too many states who have and hold the power , to stop this onslaught !
And yet they have done nothing to stop it! 
And the people of the world continue to watch as those with power will continue to do nothing day after day , to put a stop to the madness , evil , and violence of the  Israeli onslaught and their continued extermination of the many Palestinian lives they will continue to snuff out of existence, right in front of our very eyes! 
As Israel Falsely proclaims to be well within their rights to commit such atrocities! 
I ask , What has this world come to? To sit by and do nothing as such horrors continue to unfold right in front of our faces!",2024-06-24T04:12:46Z

@wjdelport8085,"Israel is allowed to do as they want. Apparently the zionist jews are superior to the ICCJ and all supreme authorities and the rest of the world. 
The fact that very little action is taken to stop the genocide proves that the findings of ICCJ and the panel in this report are toothless. Then what are the rest of the people of the world? Are we sub species of the chosen ones empowered by their god who promised them benefits and control over all of mankind? Very disappointing and depressing for me.",2024-06-22T08:27:04Z
