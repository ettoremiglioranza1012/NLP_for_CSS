Children are having their limbs amputated without anesthesia. People are living in tents, in the winter rains, disease is rampant. This is Biden's success?

No. But I do not see how there can be anything worse than keeping millions caged, starved, bombed - giving Israel the full sanction to do this. What can be worse? What? Bad words? Typos?

No. Just no.\n\nBiden could cut off aid TODAY, he could impose sanctions, he could stop vetoing UN resolutions - instead he is starting WWIII, giving our tax money for more bombs, having his advisors smugly saying that Israel is doing great and we are terrible people for bringing up what we can plainly see with out own eyes.

The actual scandal, in this narrative, will not be the mass murder of the Palestinians of Gaza in a genocidal campaign armed by the White House, but how Bibi and his band of rogues, Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, used the just war to push their ‚Äúextremist‚Äù agendas. \n\n&gt;‚ÄúIf this really goes bad, we want to be able to point to our past statements,‚Äù a senior U.S. official told NBC News in early November when the White House intensified its stealth political messaging. ‚ÄúThe official said the administration is particularly worried about a narrative taking hold that Biden supports all Israeli military actions and that U.S.-provided weapons have been used to kill Palestinian civilians, many of them women and children,‚Äù NBC reported. In other words, the White House was concerned that the cold truths about its actions could not be washed away."

        "selftext": "1.5 Million people have gathered in Istanbul today to show solidarity with the Palestinians and protest against the events in Israel. Erdogan attended the rally, too.\n\n  \nHis speech:\n\nIn all the places our horizon extends, we share the sorrows of our brothers and sisters who turn their hearts and eyes towards us. We offer our help, cross borders when necessary, just as we are standing with Gaza today. A century ago, what Adana was to this nation, Gaza is today. Scratch beneath the words of Israeli leaders, and you'll find a treacherous map that encompasses the borders of our country. The greatest responsibility for the massacre in Gaza lies with the West. Just as no game lasts forever, the West's sinister and dirty tactics have been exposed. I say to the West: Do you want to provoke a Crescent-Cross struggle? Israel has been committing war crimes openly for 22 days. We will declare you as a war criminal to the world, Israel. We are preparing for this.\n\nAt the horizon of our geography, for the eternal waving of our flag, and for the recitation of our call to prayer until the end of days, I express my gratitude to all those who work, use their intellect and sweat.\n\nYou are such a great nation that you have demonstrated it in a unique way. We are such a great nation and state that our strength and struggle are not limited to our own borders alone.\n\nOnce upon a time, we too, as a nation, showed the world what it means to be a nation, and taught the concept of nationality. In short, wherever our horizon extends, we stand in solidarity with our brothers and sisters, turning our hearts and eyes towards us, sharing their troubles, extending a helping hand, and, just as today, standing up for Gaza.\n\nFrom Crimea to Karabakh, from Bosnia to Kirkuk, from Palestine to Turkistan, from Afghanistan to Chechnya, we shed tears for many regions. Our lifetime was not in vain. Today, some perceive Gaza as a distant place, entirely unrelated to us, and even say this openly. Yet, a century ago, Gaza was what Adana was to this nation and this country. Just as Mardin is to Mosul, Gaziantep to Aleppo, Gaza was an inseparable part of the homeland we considered. How did we come this far? When you visit the √áanakkale Martyrs' Memorial, take a good look at the names and cities on the tombstones. You will see that just as there are people from Balƒ±kesir and ≈ûanlƒ±urfa, Gazans and Skopje's residents lie side by side.\n\nThere is no doubt that Turkey is a great nation. Turkey is a country that stands above never-ending major threats.\n\nI said that Hamas is not a terrorist organization, and this greatly disturbed Israel. We didn't expect anything different. Because we knew this, we expressed it clearly and openly.\n\nI said that Hamas is not a terrorist organization, and this greatly upsets Israel. We didn't expect anything different. Because we knew this, we stated it clearly and openly. We say, \"La galibe illallah,\" meaning, \"There is no victor but Allah.\" We believe in this. Only Allah is the Victor.  \nHere, we are not just interpreting the massacre in Gaza, but also defending our own independence and future. Sultan Abd√ºlhamid had significant dealings with these regions. In 1947, what was Gaza, what was Palestine, and what are they today? Israel, how did you come here, how did you enter? You are an occupier. You are an organization. The Turkish nation knows this. The West owes you, but Turkey does not owe you anything. That's why we speak so confidently. Erdogan speaks this way because Turkey does not owe you anything. Unfortunately, every country in the West owes you. They cannot speak. They come to visit you. They practically beg for forgiveness by visiting you. We don't have such a concern. We stand with the oppressed. We have always been a nation that stands with the oppressed in the face of tyranny. When the occupiers of Jerusalem are against us, the politics of those who go to the tomb of Sultan Saladin, the conqueror of this blessed city, to vent their thousand-year-old grievances have a stake. Against us are the unresolved accounts of those who have cut us into pieces politically, geographically, socially, and economically for the past two centuries. We will not allow those who fail to understand this simple truth out of negligence or try to cover it up with betrayal to distort the facts stolen by the infidels' sword.  \n\n\nThose who shed crocodile tears for civilians killed in the Ukraine-Russia war are silently watching the deaths of thousands of innocent children today. You shed tears for those who died in Ukraine, but why is your voice silent for these innocent children who died in Gaza? I say to the West: Are you trying to incite another Crescent-Cross struggle? If you are making such an effort, know that this nation is not dead. This nation stands strong. And in the same way, with the same determination, what we are in Libya, what we are in Karabakh, be aware that we are the same in the Middle East.   \n\n\nEspecially in the last 10 years, despite all the challenges, we have achieved what we set out to do in the fight against terrorism. Inshallah, we will continue to move forward on the path we have charted with the motto \"We can come suddenly one night.\" We are always ready to walk this path with our people. With the permission of Allah, this nation is ready to write new epics.\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/17ihgpl/video/esni55r20zwb1/player\n\nThe greatest responsibility for the massacre in Gaza lies with the West. Just as no game lasts forever, the West's sinister and dirty tactics have now been exposed. We are well aware of who is behind the worthless terrorists raised against us in the north of Iraq and Syria. Who stands behind the PKK, YPG, and FET√ñ?\n\nWhen it comes to talk, we know very well the reasons for which human rights advocacy institutions and individuals are trying to hinder our country.  \n\n\nThe Western world has mobilized, from politicians to the media, to legitimize the massacre of women, children, and innocent people in Gaza. Israel has been openly committing war crimes for 22 days. Israel, we will declare you as a war criminal to the world. We are preparing for this. We are working on this, and we will introduce Israel to the world as a war criminal.  \n\n\nMarketplaces, schools, and every standing structure are the targets of this barbarism. Over 30,000 buildings and more than 200,000 residences have been completely devastated. There is almost no home left for any Gazan to seek shelter in. The infrastructure for electricity, water, and sewage has already been entirely destroyed. Due to the lack of permission for outside assistance, essential needs like electricity, food, healthcare, and sanitation materials couldn't be met. Despite this grim situation, the dignified and unwavering stance of the people of Gaza will be recorded in history as a resistance epic. Faith and determination are such qualities that, as our ancestors used to say, can even extract milk from a bull.   \nThe people of Gaza are ready to defend their homeland with their teeth. Are we ready as well? This nation has done it. They did it yesterday, they are doing it today, and with the permission of Allah, they will do it tomorrow. None of the Palestinians who once left their homes, thinking they would find peace when they returned, ever made it back. Now, they are saying the same thing for the people of Gaza. What are these immoral people saying? They are telling them to go. When asked where, they say to the desert, to cross into another country. They point to that door. Those who listen to these words and set out on the road because they are injured or desperate are met with bombs raining down on them. Because all they know is how to kill. I salute the determination of the people of Gaza to not leave their homes and cities on behalf of my nation.   \n   \nWhen your own homes start to burn, the Western back you leaned on will pull out, and Israel, which has oppressed people and their brothers for 75 years, will be left alone. Israel, mark my words: Just like 500 years ago, Turkey will be the hope for these people, just as it has been for every oppressed when they are in trouble. I reiterate the call I made to the Israeli government in recent days: Do not dull the merciful feelings of the Turkish nation with empty words and attitudes that exceed your stature. Just like your ancestors, your children and their children will also need Turkey in the future. Come today and listen to us to not let their outstretched hands fall. Listen to our call to establish peace by opening the doors for dialogue to meet our request to deliver aid to the oppressed today. \n\n\\#############  \nLast week, President Erdogan and top diplomats increased pressure on Israel. The Turkish Foreign Minister said: \"Either there will be a major war or a major peace\".\n\nAs a protest, Turkey has canceled plans for joint exploitation of gas reserves in the eastern Mediterranean with Israel and all diplomatic visits between the two countries. Erdogan has clearly supported Hamas, referring to them as freedom fighters and mujahidun, while Turkey does not consider Hamas a terrorist organization.\n\nIn the Hagia Sophia, the Director of Religious Affairs of Turkey delivered a Friday sermon with both hands on a sword hilt, which has a traditional meaning and referencing the a conquest period. According to this tradition inherited from the Ottoman era, a sword held in the right hand is meant to intimidate the enemy, while a sword held in the left hand is meant to inspire confidence in allies.   \n\n\nOn October 18, 2023, Turkey declared a three-day state mourning due to an attack on a hospital that resulted in over 500 casualties.",

And some frustrated muslims, who seem to be frustrated and say these are empty words.\n\nFollowing since many years the news, which countries in the islamic world speak-up and stand-up for the palestinians, besides the Turks? In my mind are the Iranians, but I don't trust them, for many reasons. So from Morocco to Indonesia, who is there? The large muslim countries, like Saudi Arabia, Egypt or Pakistan, did they say \"one night we will come (after you)?\", did they say \"we are preparing to show the world that Israel is commiting war crimes\" to or did they blamed the West that harshly. Did they say the Hamas are \"freedom\" fighters and \"mujahidun\"? Alone the fact, that Hamas is founded by the \"Muslim Brotherhood\", is enough for Egypt and Saudi Arabia not to help Palestinians.  \n\n\nIn my opinion, Erdogan is preparing the Turks for confrontation with Israel and the West. Because, if Turkey will do so, the Turks can be sure to get sanctioned and worse by the west. If Turkey will try to hit Israel economically, the revenge of the West will be the same. If Turkey backs Palestine militarily, do you think the West would just watch? So he has to prepare mentally the Turks for harsh times - and this is a typical tactic. The same is doing the West and Israel with their population by using the media, too.  \nTo that, you can't take action against a country, without legitimating it. Hence, Turkey is pushing the UN to recognize that Israel is doing war crimes. Even the US blamed Saddam for having weapons of mass destruction in front of the UN before attacking Iraq. Turkey on the other doesn't have to lie about the atrocities Israel is doing. The same thing Turkey did 1974 in Cyprus, 2016 in Syria and also in the late 2010s and the last years with Greece (without an intervention).  \nHe also tries to establish a mental bond between Turks and Palestine, by saying that these lands were only 100 years ago the Ottoman Empire and that Palestinians fought in WW I on the side of the Turks.  \nLast but not least, the sentence \"one night we will come\" was used by Erdogan many times before, where Turkey in fact intervened, for example in Syria, Iraq, Libya and Karabakh. If these words are empty, Israel would not cut the diplomatic relations with Turkey by today (see Eli Cohen tweet, the FM of Israel)."

These are an indoctrinated people who are brainwashed to feel entitled to the land and conditioned to fear &amp; hate the indigenous people, who simply by existing as natives, threaten their disconnected identities. They're foreign tourists ‚Äî colonizers who cosplay as \"Levantians\", yet in practice could never replicate the traditions and customs that Palestinians have cultivated for centuries, which tie them to the land. Deep down they understand this distinction, fear it and wish to eliminate it. If this were merely about terrorists, then that's who they'd target. But to them all Palestinians are threats, bc they are a reminder of which group carries an ACTUAL relationship with the land that isn't reduced to property ownership and resource exploitation."

        "selftext": "*Please be advised:*¬†[This content](https://www.quora.com/Was-Israel-out-numbered-and-outgunned-in-1948-war/answer/Handala-2)¬†*forms a segment of the \"*[What Every Palestinian Should Know](https://handala.net/need-to-know/)*\" series, presented by*¬†[Handala](https://www.quora.com/profile/Handala-2)¬†*on*¬†[Palestine Today](https://palestinetoday.quora.com/)*.*\n\n*The miraculous genesis of Israel was achieved through a heroic and desperate battle for survival. Outnumbered and outgunned, the fledgling Jewish state held its own against overwhelming military odds and persevered.*\n\nI‚Äôm certain that such a narrative makes for some great story-telling, not to mention indoctrination; tales of plucky underdogs overcoming their powerful bullies have always resonated with people and elicited their sympathies. However, as far as foundational tales in the context of nation building tend to be, they are more¬†**mythology than reality**. Such tall stories cannot withstand even elementary research or scrutiny.\n\nIt is not difficult to understand the allure of such a narrative for Israelis and their supporters, as it functions on multiple levels. It evokes a modern-day David and Goliath, which bestows¬†**moral superiority**¬†to the¬†**Zionist colonists**, further reinforcing notions that they were favored by God, karma, justice, the universe or whatever metaphysical force you believe in (or don‚Äôt). This interplays wonderfully with the claimed Israeli¬†*purity of arms*¬†(Tohar HaNeshek) where Israeli weapons are framed as ‚Äúpure‚Äù because they are used¬†**only**¬†in self-defence and¬†**never**¬†against innocents. It also serves to augment Zionist claims of technical¬†**superiority**¬†over the¬†**natives**, as a small number of the enlightened and civilized colonists managed to hold out against¬†*seven*whole nations! If this isn‚Äôt further proof that they are more deserving of the land by virtue of their ingenuity and strength then nothing is.\n\nUnfortunately, as many myths regarding Israel tend to be, this is an enduring one that is still widespread today, especially within Israel itself. Up until relatively recently it was virtually unchallenged in the world outside the Arab states and those sympathetic to the Palestinian cause. It began to be challenged seriously with the advent of the so-called Israeli¬†[New Historians](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3013159?casa_token=Y-M2gY8ZtpIAAAAA%3A697eWlqJdyUQDYy_PeUPieMBRhfndM6c7U1zXCmSx_9JcvZ2M6JgRwwRTmcjfVm1uET0uRpN_5-1QnIWU6fY6TzUFqvaL1farAmFRbYX6mLjLXmr-Ms&amp;seq=3#metadata_info_tab_contents), who with access to declassified Israeli war archives offered a ‚Äúnew‚Äù, more critical look at Israel‚Äôs foundational myths. As far as Orientalism goes, this is nothing new, Palestinian and Arab claims are often dismissed as biased and unscientific, while Israeli claims are accepted with hardly any scrutiny at all. For example, the Palestinian narrative of the Nakba, including acknowledging¬†**the ethnic cleansing and war crimes**¬†committed by¬†**Zionist**¬†militias¬†**did not**¬†even earn a glance from Western audiences until it was confirmed by Israeli scholars, but this is a different topic for a different answer.\n\nAvi Shlaim¬†[argues](https://www.jstor.org/stable/176252?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents)¬†that the disconnect between the Israeli narrative and reality is further aided by the fact that:\n\n&gt;*‚ÄúMost of the voluminous literature on the war was written*¬†***not***¬†*by professional historians but by participants, by politicians, soldiers, official historians and by a large host of sympathetic chroniclers, journalists, biographers and hagiographers.‚Äù*\n\nTherefore, most ‚Äúhistorical‚Äù writings on the war are relegated to the realm of¬†**political**¬†claim-making rather than¬†**honestly reflecting**¬†the history and events of the war.\n\n**With this in mind, what does the historical data say on the question of Israelis being outnumbered in the 1948 war?**\n\nUnsurprisingly, the¬†[data](https://bookscouter.com/buy/0679720987-the-birth-of-israel-myths-and-realities)¬†says that it was in fact the¬†**Arab armies which were outnumbered**. The actual debate here is about the¬†*degree*¬†to which the Arab armies were outnumbered. Let us look at a few sources:\n\nLet us begin with the¬†[numbers of John Glubb](https://bookscouter.com/buy/0340020504-soldier-with-the-arabs), commander of the Arab Legion during the war, who estimated that on May 15th -the outbreak of the war- the numbers of troops were roughly as follows:\n\n**Country followed by Number of troops**\n\nALA = 2000\n\nEgypt = 10000\n\nTransjordan = 4500\n\nIraq = 3000\n\nSyria = 3000\n\nLebanon = 1000\n\nArab total = 21500\n\nIsrael total = 65000\n\nHow could this be? How could such a numerical advantage be swept under the rug and be so grossly misrepresented? Perhaps as commander of the Arab Legion, he purposefully exaggerated the number of Israeli troops, and downplayed the number of Arab troops.\n\nLet us look at another source, this time the estimates of the¬†[brothers Kimche](https://books.google.ps/books/about/Both_Sides_of_the_Hill.html?id=LrMcAAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y), who have been very vocal about their¬†**Zionism**. They estimated the balance of power on May the 15th as such:\n\nCountry followed by Number of troops\n\nALA = 2000\n\nEgypt = 10000\n\nTransjordan = 4500\n\nIraq = 3000\n\nSyria = 3000\n\nLebanon = 1000\n\nArab total = 23500\n\nIsrael total = 25000\n\nThe main differences in these estimates, is that Kimche added the Arab Liberation Army to their estimates for the Arab side, and¬†**trimmed**¬†the Israeli total down to 25000. Even in this very conservative estimate, the Israeli army¬†**outnumbered**¬†every single Arab army combined. But what is the reason for such a large discrepancy? How did 65000 become 25000?\n\nWalid Khalidi¬†[sheds some light](https://bookscouter.com/buy/0887281567-from-haven-to-conquest)¬†on this, as he differentiates between¬†**first-line mobilized Zionist soldiers and second-line troops in the settlements.**¬†Glubb¬†**partially accounted**¬†for these in his numbers, Kimche elected to¬†**omit**¬†them completely. Here are Khalidi's numbers:\n\n**Country followed by Number of troops**\n\nALA = 3830\n\nPalestinian Arabs = 2563\n\nEgypt = 2800\n\nTransjordan = 4500\n\nIraq = 4000\n\nSyria = 1876\n\nLebanon = 700\n\nArab total = 20269\n\nIsrael first-line = 27000\n\nIsrael second-line = 90000+\n\nIsrael total = 117000+\n\nShlaim¬†[goes even further](https://www.jstor.org/stable/176252?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents)¬†and estimates that the number of first-line Israeli troops was at¬†**35000**¬†on May 15th. So even if we were to¬†**omit**¬†these second-line forces -for some reason- there is a solid scholarly consensus that¬†**it was actually the Arab armies that were outnumbered**.¬†Remember that these numbers are for¬†**May 15th**, the¬†**first**¬†day of the war. The numbers¬†**did not**¬†remain static. As a matter of fact, the longer the war went on for,¬†**the more the numerical gap between the sides widened**¬†in¬†[Israel's favor](https://www.jstor.org/stable/176252?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents). Between March and July, almost¬†**13,000 trained men arrived from abroad**¬†to join the war on the Israeli side,¬†**by mid-June Ben Gurion noted that the IDF stood at 41,000, in addition to the 90,000 second line units as a complement to the IDF.** There were efforts to increase these 90000 to 112000. The Arab states also reinforced their armies, but they were never able to¬†**keep up**¬†with the numbers of the Israeli side.¬†**At the end stages of the war, the Israeli army actually outnumbered the Arab armies by 2 to 1.**¬†This is¬†**not**¬†even delving into the¬†**qualitative difference**¬†in troops, as¬†**many troops on the Israeli side**¬†had¬†[combat experience¬†](https://bookscouter.com/buy/0679720987-the-birth-of-israel-myths-and-realities)from the¬†**world wars**¬†as well as¬†**superior equipment and tools**¬†after the first truce.\n\n**Inter-Arab politics:**\n\nHowever, another aspect that is often¬†**ignored**¬†in this narrative is the inter-Arab rivalries and disunity that were the main cause for the intervention in 1948. Contrary to popular framings of the 1948 war, and despite their fiery rhetoric, the Arab countries and leaders were¬†[not interested in a war with Israel](https://bookscouter.com/buy/0679720987-the-birth-of-israel-myths-and-realities). Barely coming out from under¬†**colonialism**, their actions during the war showed that they¬†**never**¬†really joined the war with eliminationist intent, as the popular narrative goes. The¬†**Jordanians**¬†were more interested in acquiring the¬†**West Bank**¬†as a stepping stone to their real ambition, which was Greater Syria. As a matter of fact, there is¬†[ample evidence](https://bookscouter.com/buy/9780679720980-the-birth-of-israel-myths-and-realities)¬†of collusion between the Israelis and Jordanians during the 1948 war, with¬†**deals under the table pretty much gifting parts of the West Bank to Jordan in return for not interfering in other areas.**¬†This is why¬†**Glubb Pasha**, commander of the Arab Legion, described the 1948 war as a ‚Äú[phoney war](https://bookscouter.com/buy/9780300151121-1948-a-history-of-the-first-arab-israeli-war)‚Äú.\n\nThe¬†**Egyptians**¬†intervened in an attempt to counter the Hashemite power-play that could change the balance of power in the region. This is why the Arab armies generally intervened in the territories of the mandate destined to be part of the Palestinian Arab state according to the¬†**1947 partition plan, and with very few exceptions, stayed away from the area destined to be part of the Jewish state.**¬†Yes, support for Palestine and Palestinians played a large role in the legitimization of such interventions, but they were¬†never¬†the real reason behind them. As per usual when it comes to international relations,¬†interests¬†are always at the center of any maneuver¬†**despite**¬†the espoused noble and altruistic motivations.\n\nUltimately, Israel enjoyed a number of advantages which are¬†**often downplayed if not completely omitted**¬†from this ‚Äúunderdog‚Äù mythical version of history:\n\n**Significant superiority in numbers, technical and military training courtesy of veterans of the world wars, sympathetic allies in Europe who smuggled advanced weaponry and equipment and troops into the country, as well as a centralized command which ensured unity in goals, organization and tactics.**\n\nIn short, there was¬†**nothing**¬†***‚Äúmiraculous‚Äù***¬†about the Israeli victory in 1948. The better organized, better armed and most numerous side won. This is why when spreading this narrative the only numbers mentioned are the number of Arab states that wanted to team up on Israel but still couldn‚Äôt win. This is an attempt to imply numerical superiority on the side of the Arab states without explicitly claiming it, as it is¬†**complete nonsense**¬†when even briefly researched.\n\nThe endurance of this myth stems from the¬†**desperate**¬†need of the¬†**Zionist settlers for the illusion of moral superiority in the foundation of their colony.**¬†After all, it is hard to sell the scrappy, righteous underdog survivor story if the numbers show you to be the top dog in this situation. This is not a uniquely Israeli quality, however, as in most foundational narratives, it is mostly myth legitimizing horrible acts of cruelty. One need look no further than foundational myths in other settler colonies like the United States or Canada to see how twisting and omitting history is used to legitimize the powers that be.\n\n**Israeli forces:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fzz3llrqukqe1.jpg?width=602&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=13ed5f1f761cda37c3bf838b79ea8e833f2b7ddc\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/45eapq0rukqe1.jpg?width=220&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=becc1fada709d90269f3749edb96484f934b1de3\n\n**Further reading:**\n\n* Said, Edward W.¬†*The war for Palestine: rewriting the history of 1948*.

                "body": "A war crimes complaint against 10 Britons who served with the Israeli military in Gaza is to be submitted to the Met police by one of the UK‚Äôs leading human rights lawyers.\n\nMichael Mansfield KC is one of a group of lawyers who will on Monday hand in a 240-page dossier to Scotland Yard‚Äôs war crimes unit alleging targeted killing of civilians and aid workers, including by sniper fire, and indiscriminate attacks on civilian areas, including hospitals.\n\nThe report, which has been prepared by a team of UK lawyers and researchers in The Hague, also accuses suspects of coordinated attacks on protected sites including historic monuments and religious sites, and forced transfer and displacement of civilians.\n\nFor legal reasons, neither the names of suspects, who include officer-level individuals, nor the full report are being made public.\n\nIsrael has persistently denied that its political leaders or military have committed war crimes during its assault on Gaza, in which it has killed more than 50,000 people, most of them civilians. The military campaign was in response to Hamas‚Äôs 7 October 2023 attack on southern Israel, in which more than 1,200 people, also mostly civilian, were killed and a further 250 taken hostage.\n\nMansfield, who is known for his work on landmark cases such as the Grenfell Tower fire, Stephen Lawrence and the Birmingham Six, said: ‚ÄúIf one of our nationals is committing an offence, we ought to be doing something about it. Even if we can‚Äôt stop the government of foreign countries behaving badly, we can at least stop our nationals from behaving badly.\n\n‚ÄúBritish nationals are under a legal obligation not to collude with crimes committed in Palestine. No one is above the law.‚Äù\n\nThe report, which has been submitted on behalf of the Gaza-based Palestinian Centre for Human Rights (PCHR) and the British-based Public Interest Law Centre (PILC), covers alleged offences committed in the territory from October 2023 to May 2024 and took six months to compile.\n\nEach of the crimes attributed to the 10 suspects, some of whom are dual nationals, amounts to a war crime or crime against humanity, according to the report.\n\nOne witness, who was at a medical facility, saw corpses ‚Äúscattered on the ground, especially in the middle of the hospital courtyard, where many dead bodies were buried in a mass grave‚Äù. A bulldozer ‚Äúran over a dead body in a horrific and heart-wrenching scene desecrating the dead‚Äù, the witness said. They also said a bulldozer demolished part of the hospital.\n\nSean Summerfield, a barrister at Doughty Street Chambers, who helped compile the dossier, said it was based on open-source evidence and witness testimony, which together presented a ‚Äúcompelling‚Äù case.\n\n‚ÄúThe public will be shocked, I would have thought, to hear that there‚Äôs credible evidence that Brits have been directly involved in committing some of those atrocities,‚Äù he said, adding that the team wanted to see individuals ‚Äúappearing at the Old Bailey to answer for atrocity crimes‚Äù.\n\nThe report says Britain has a responsibility under international treaties to investigate and prosecute those who have committed ‚Äúcore international crimes‚Äù.\n\nSection 51 of the International Criminal Court Act 2001 states that it ‚Äúis an offence against the law of England and Wales for a person to commit genocide, a crime against humanity, or a war crime‚Äù, even if it takes place in another country.\n\nRaji Sourani, the director of the PCHR, said: ‚ÄúThis is illegal, this is inhuman and enough is enough. The government cannot say we didn‚Äôt know; we are providing them with all the evidence.‚Äù\n\nPaul Heron, the legal director of the PILC, said: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre filing our report to make clear these war crimes are not in our name.‚Äù\n\nScores of legal and human rights experts have signed a letter of support urging the war crimes team to investigate the complaints."

        "title": "Israeli War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity: A Chronological Recap (1948‚ÄìPresent)",
        "selftext": "*Palestinian protest in Gaza (flag and keffiyeh symbolize enduring resistance).* For 75+ years, Israeli state forces have repeatedly been accused of violations of international law against Palestinians. Human rights monitors and UN bodies document a pattern of expulsion, disproportionate force, and collective punishment. From the 1948 Nakba through recent Gaza wars, Israeli policies ‚Äì from mass displacement and house demolitions to indiscriminate bombardments ‚Äì have drawn accusations of war crimes and crimes against humanity by Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, UN commissions and courts, and others. The chronology below highlights key incidents by period, each supported by independent reports.\n\n# 1948‚Äì1967: Nakba and Early Occupation\n\n* **1948 (Nakba):** In the war surrounding Israel‚Äôs creation, Israeli forces expelled roughly **700,000 Palestinians** from their homes and destroyed over 400 villages [Source: B‚ÄôTselem](). Survivors were prevented from returning by discriminatory laws, and became refugees. Human rights analysts describe the 1948 expulsions as ethnic cleansing and note that Israel‚Äôs laws enshrined a system of racial discrimination (apartheid) against remaining Palestinians [Source: HRW]() [Source: UN](https://www.un.org/unispal/document/auto-insert-199084/). These mass expulsions and destruction of civilian villages violated the Hague and Geneva Conventions (prohibiting forced transfer of protected persons) and are now widely regarded as crimes against humanity.\n* **1948‚Äì1966 (within Israel):** Palestinian citizens of Israel were placed under prolonged military rule and denied full rights. Many lost land and livelihoods. Rights groups note that Israeli policies during this period (land confiscation, residency revocations, oppressive military orders) were part of an overarching strategy of domination that international observers call apartheid and persecution [Source: UN](https://www.un.org/unispal/document/auto-insert-198156/) [Source: UN](https://www.un.org/unispal/document/auto-insert-198156/).\n* **1950s‚Äì1960s (continued expulsions):** In the early state period, Israeli forces also carried out punitive raids and village destructions in the occupied West Bank and Gaza (held by Jordan and Egypt until 1967). For example, in 1956 Israeli commandoes attacked Palestinian villages in the Jordan Valley, killing dozens. (Israel‚Äôs 1956 Sinai War also involved heavy civilian casualties in Gaza.) These actions involved indiscriminate fire on civilians and destruction of property, violating laws of war and amounting to war crimes by today‚Äôs standards.\n\n# 1967‚Äì1987: Occupation and Settlements\n\n* **1967 (Six-Day War):** Israel captured the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem. It immediately imposed military occupation on millions of Palestinians. Within weeks it began appropriating land and housing for new Jewish settlements, in contravention of the Fourth Geneva Convention. Amnesty International emphasizes that the very existence of these settlements ‚Äúviolates international humanitarian law and is a war crime‚Äù [Source: Amnesty](). Over the following decades Israel confiscated tens of thousands of hectares, demolished homes to make way for settlers, and barred Palestinians from their lands [Source: Amnesty]() [Source: Amnesty]().\n* **Settlement Expansion:** By 1987 Israel supported over 300,000 settlers in the West Bank and Gaza [Source: Amnesty](). Human Rights Watch and others note that settlement-building ‚Äì which involves transferring Israeli civilians onto occupied territory and seizing Palestinian property ‚Äì meets the Rome Statute‚Äôs definition of a war crime [Source: HRW]() [Source: Amnesty](). In practice, settlers often used violence to drive out Palestinians; Israeli forces typically failed to protect civilians. (For instance, during the 1980s wave of settlement construction, entire Palestinian hamlets were uprooted.)\n* **Sabra-Shatila Massacre (1982):** During Israel‚Äôs invasion of Lebanon, Israeli forces allowed allied Christian militias into the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps. The militias massacred an estimated **2,000‚Äì3,500** Palestinian and Lebanese civilians. Video and testimonies confirm Israeli tanks encircling the camps and shooting at civilians trying to flee [Source: UN](https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/37/123). The UN General Assembly deemed this slaughter a ‚Äúmassacre‚Äù and investigators found Israeli troops withheld water and light for the victims. While the direct killings were by the militia, Israel‚Äôs facilitation (blockading exits and turning flares on by night) makes this a grievous war crime for which Israeli officials bear indirect responsibility [Source: UN](https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/37/123).\n\n# 1987‚Äì2000: First Intifada and Repression\n\n* **First Intifada (1987‚Äì1993):** Palestinian uprising met with brutal Israeli response. Human Rights Watch documented that from late 1987 to early 1990 Israeli forces killed **over 670** Palestinians (many unarmed) and wounded thousands more [Source: HRW](). IDF rules of engagement allowed live fire against stone-throwers, resulting in routine use of lethal force against non-violent demonstrators. HRW reported systematic rights violations: injuries and deaths from live ammunition, beatings, torture in detention, and punitive measures (mass curfews, home demolitions) [Source: HRW]() [Source: UN](https://www.un.org/unispal/document/auto-insert-198156/). Many of these acts ‚Äì deliberately targeting civilians without threat and collective punishment ‚Äì flagrantly violated international humanitarian law. The brutality was widely condemned as constituting war crimes (e.g. willful killings of protesters) and crimes against humanity (persecution of a civilian population under occupation) [Source: HRW]() [Source: UN](https://www.un.org/unispal/document/auto-insert-198156/).\n* **Civilian Killings and Demolitions:** Throughout the Intifada Israel imposed harsh measures: firing on refugee camp rallies, bulldozing houses of suspected attackers, and shooting patients at checkpoints. For example, on March 31, 1988, Israeli forces surrounded the Birzeit University dormitory (defended only by unarmed students) and shot 30 Palestinians as they surrendered. Such incidents of firing on unarmed Palestinians were documented by [Source: Amnesty]() and [Source: UN](https://www.un.org/unispal/document/auto-insert-198156/) as grave breaches of the laws of war.\n\n# 2000‚Äì2023: Gaza Wars and Ongoing Occupation\n\n* **Second Intifada (2000‚Äì2005):** A renewed uprising led to intense combat. Notably, in April 2002 the IDF stormed the Jenin refugee camp in the West Bank under ‚ÄúOperation Defensive Shield.‚Äù Human Rights Watch and other observers found extensive evidence of war crimes in Jenin: summary executions of unarmed residents, torture of detainees, and wanton destruction of civilian infrastructure [Source: HRW]() [Source: HRW](). Over 50 Palestinians were killed there (many civilians), and hospitals, mosques, and hundreds of homes were demolished with no military necessity. HRW explicitly urged Israeli authorities to launch criminal investigations of individual commanders for these abuses [Source: HRW]().\n* **Gaza Blockade (2007‚Äì2023):** After Hamas took Gaza in 2007, Israel imposed a land-air-sea blockade. The United Nations and ICRC call the blockade ‚Äúcollective punishment‚Äù of Gaza‚Äôs 2 million people [Source: UN](https://www.un.org/unispal/document/report-of-the-secretary-general-on-situation-gaza-strip/) [Source: ICRC](). It has choked fuel, electricity, food and medicine into Gaza, contributing to humanitarian crisis and death. International experts argue that imposing starvation or denial of aid on civilians in an occupied territory amounts to a war crime. (Indeed, Israel‚Äôs recent ICC indictment charges its leaders with ‚Äústarvation of civilians as a method of warfare‚Äù in Gaza [Source: ICC]()).\n* **Operation Cast Lead (2008‚Äì2009):** In this 3‚Äëweek Gaza war, IDF operations killed about **1,400 Palestinians** (including \\~300 children) [Source: Amnesty](). Amnesty documented that Israeli forces used heavy aerial bombardment and tank fire on densely populated neighborhoods. They bombed homes and UN schools without warning, even while children slept inside, violating the principles of distinction and proportionality [Source: Amnesty](). Witnesses described bombardments that flattened entire families. Analysts noted that the scale of civilian death and destruction indicated systematic disregard for civilian life. Both the UN and rights groups concluded that many attacks were indiscriminate or disproportionate, amounting to war crimes [Source: Amnesty]() [Source: UN](https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/HRC/RES/10/9).\n* **Gaza War 2014 (Operation Protective Edge):** Over 50 days of fighting killed more than **2,000 Palestinians** (around 550 children) [Source: UN](https://www.un.org/unispal/document/report-of-the-independent-commission-of-inquiry-on-the-2014-gaza-conflict/) and wounded over 10,000. Amnesty UK reported extensive evidence of unlawful strikes: many homes were hit directly without prior warning, and in some cases hospitals and mosques were bombed [Source: Amnesty](). Even Israel‚Äôs deputy leader Nick Clegg called the bombardment ‚Äúdeliberately disproportionate‚Äù and ‚Äúcollective punishment‚Äù [Source: UN](https://www.un.org/unispal/document/report-of-the-independent-commission-of-inquiry-on-the-2014-gaza-conflict/). Human Rights Watch and Amnesty found credible allegations that Israeli forces carried out airstrikes that ravaged entire civilian apartment blocks far from any military targets ‚Äì acts that would constitute war crimes [Source: UN](https://www.un.org/unispal/document/report-of-the-independent-commission-of-inquiry-on-the-2014-gaza-conflict/) [Source: Amnesty]().\n* **Great March of Return (2018‚Äì2019):** Weekly Gaza protests demanding end to the siege were met by Israeli snipers. Human Rights Watch and Amnesty documented that at least **186 Palestinians** (including over 40 children) were shot dead by Israeli forces in these demonstrations. On 14 May 2018 alone, 59 unarmed protesters were killed by live fire [Source: UN]() [Source: Amnesty](). Medics and journalists were also shot. Such use of lethal force against largely peaceful demonstrators (throwing stones or tires only) violated the rules of engagement; investigators have said many of these killings appear unlawful.\n* **Settler Violence and Forced Displacement:** Throughout the 2000s and 2010s, Jewish settler militias (often backed by the army) attacked Palestinian villagers in the West Bank, burning homes and orchards. In several incidents (e.g. Duma, 2015), extremists murdered Palestinian children. Israel‚Äôs failure to stop or prosecute these acts (often planting soldiers nearby) effectively made the state an accomplice. Amnesty warns this violence is part of a ‚Äústate-backed campaign‚Äù of dispossession under apartheid [Source: Amnesty]() [Source: HRW](). Each new settlement or eviction (like in East Jerusalem‚Äôs Sheikh Jarrah district) involves forcible transfer of Palestinians ‚Äì an act international law deems a war crime. (As UN special rapporteurs have noted, the evictions violate rights to housing and could amount to forcible displacement [Source: Amnesty]() [Source: HRW]()).\n\n# 2023‚ÄìPresent: Gaza War and Genocide Allegations\n\n* **2023 Gaza War (Oct 2023‚ÄìJan 2025):** After Hamas‚Äôs Oct. 7 attacks, Israel launched an intensive 15‚Äëmonth offensive on Gaza. UN monitoring groups report roughly **47,000 Palestinians killed** (about 70% women and children) and 111,000 wounded, with nearly 70% of Gaza‚Äôs infrastructure destroyed [Source: UN](). The UN‚Äôs Independent Commission of Inquiry (Oct. 2024) concluded Israel has employed a ‚Äúconcerted policy to destroy Gaza‚Äôs healthcare system‚Äù and deliberately targeted civilians, doctors, hospitals, even UN shelters [Source: UN]() [Source: UN](). It found Israeli forces committed war crimes and the crime against humanity of ‚Äúextermination‚Äù through relentless attacks on medical workers and beds [Source: UN]() [Source: UN](). The report detailed multiple strikes that killed entire families, ambulances and babies, and documented torture and killings of Palestinian detainees. Thousands of Palestinians (including children) held in Israeli custody were found to have been systematically beaten, sexualized and deprived of food ‚Äì acts the Commission classifies as war crimes and crimes against humanity (torture, rape) [Source: UN](). In sum, the Inquiry determined Israeli forces committed repeated atrocities ‚Äì intentional attacks on non-combatants, starvation as warfare, sexual violence, and forced transfers ‚Äì that violate the Geneva Conventions.\n* **Accountability Efforts:** International bodies have responded. In July 2023 the UN‚Äôs top court (ICJ) ordered Israel to halt actions ‚Äúwithin the scope of genocide‚Äù ‚Äì orders Israel has largely ignored. The International Criminal Court opened a full investigation in 2021 into all parties, and on 21 Nov. 2024 the ICC issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and Defense Minister Gallant, charging them with war crimes (using starvation as a method, intentionally attacking civilians) and crimes against humanity (murder, persecution, etc.) during the Gaza onslaught [Source: ICC](). Human Rights Watch and Amnesty have repeatedly urged Israel to investigate and prosecute those responsible for the killings, instead of granting immunity [Source: HRW]() [Source: Amnesty]().\n\nOver decades, reports from the UN, ICC, and leading NGOs paint a consistent picture: Israeli military and state actors have carried out large-scale violations of international law against Palestinians, from the 1948 expulsion to recent Gaza campaigns. These include forcible displacement, indiscriminate bombing of civilians, torture of detainees, and other abuses that rights groups call war crimes and crimes against humanity [Source: Amnesty]() [Source: UN](https://www.un.org/). Despite clear documentation by independent sources, accountability has been almost entirely lacking. The ICC‚Äôs recent indictment of Israeli leaders and numerous UN resolutions underscore mounting demands for justice. In summary, the chronicle of abuses by Israeli forces reflects a sustained pattern of atrocities against Palestinians ‚Äì for which activists and legal experts insist there must finally be impartial investigations and accountability [Source: ICC](https://www.icc-cpi.int/) [Source: HRW](https://www.hrw.org/).\n\n**Sources:** Authoritative investigations by the UN (Special Rapporteurs, Commissions of Inquiry), Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and other NGOs, as well as ICC and international legal analyses [Source: Amnesty](https://www.amnesty.org/) [Source: UN](https://www.un.org/) [Source: ICC](https://www.icc-cpi.int/) [Source: HRW](https://www.hrw.org/).

If you're willing to let a Palestinian baby starve to death, freeze to death, be obliterated and incinerated by western made weapons--there's no fairy tale we weave about ourselves that is true.\n\nWe lost the right to look down on Muslim, Islamic and Arabic people. We are the true monsters. The real boogeymen."

Hamas has denied such allegations.\n\nThe dramatic operation in the early hours of the morning was the latest in a series of incidents in the West Bank, which has seen an explosion of violence since the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7 and the subsequent invasion of Gaza by Israel.\n\nJenin, in the northern part of the West Bank, has witnessed some of the biggest clashes, with repeated Israeli attacks on the densely packed Palestinian refugee camp adjoining the city.\n\nThousands of mourners poured into the streets of the camp during the day as the three men killed in the raid were buried.\n\nFrom Reuters",

I am looking for some real qoutes now because I have realised that alot of people have never read or heard how germans justified what they were doing and how shocking similar it is to what Zionists say.\n\nEdit: /satirical quote!\n\nIt's February 1941, people are raising concerns of genocide. German living in the west,\n\n\"how dare you demonise the German people that way. If we wanted to we could wipe out all Jews and Slavs in a matter of days. Instead we are supply food and supplies to there communities and there are even plans to give them free train rides to work camps that have swimming pools! We need to root out the evil jewish communist idealogy that is present in these communities. Don't forget that the Jewish people made us lose WW1 by stabbing us in the back and want the complete destruction of the German state and people! We are merely acting in self defence.\""

Although they did mass kill communists, lgbt, disabled, homeless, the invalid and Romani before 1941.\n\nOr that the Jews weren't going to be their final stop. They needed to ethnic cleanse and genocide alot of Slavic people to make way for Lebensraum to create a greater Germany.\n\n11 million Slav civilians were killed by the Germans in ww2 including some at nazi death camps (my polish grandfather survived a nazi death camp in ww2).\n\nLike I feel like people don't learn the lessons of history correctly.

But  it means that where there should be context to help us understand how such a horrendous event took place, there is a void, and the holocaust is therefore seen by many as a singular evil that can‚Äôt be compared to any other event and cannot be learned from. This puts the Jewish people in an odd position of perpetual victimhood too, no matter how far removed we become from the pogroms."

Especially in high school.\n\nAt a university level history you hear all the motivations as to why they did it and how they justified it to themselves.\n\nBut how many people study tertiary level history on nazi germany? Not many.\n\nI think this backfires because is what it creates is holocaust deniers. But people are worried that people would emulate those beliefs.\n\nBut it means is that people don't learn from history.\n\nI will give an example with Poland.\n\nInternationally germany said that Poland attacked first to justify war to its people and the international community.\n\nHowever to justify ethnic cleansing to it used history.\n\nBelow is me compiling various Nazi officials justifications that I half remember from 12 years ago on my phone so take it with a massive grain of salt. But it gives you an idea about tge stuff they said. \n\nThe region know as Poland once belonged to germany but was ethnicly cleansed by Slavic people in about the 4th century AD. In fact Poland and polish people did not exist for hundreds of years after. As far as the nazis were concerned all poles were Slavic and all Slavics were the same. Slavic people were just occupying lands that belonged to the master race and that by ethnicly cleaning them east they were correcting a historical injustice. This allowed the Nazis to obtain their goal of Lebensraum and create greater germany. In fact they were sending them back to their homeland in the far  east.\n\nHowever there was an issue. The Jews had taking over the Slavic homeland of Russia with the Jewish idealogy of communism (remember Karl Marx was Jewish and many secular Jews were socialist or communist) so in order to allow the Slavs of Poland ro return to their homeland they needed to destroy the Jewish communist rulers who controlled the Soviet Union.\n\nThey were absolutely insane. They use historical facts to create a pseudo historical fiction to justify them taking other people's lands and killing them.\n\nWho dose that sound like?"

Israel‚Äôs \"Neighbor Procedure\" was infamous. This involves Israeli soldiers forcing Palestinian civilians to perform military operations. For example, neighbours of targeted homes or buildings are called upon to knock on doors, check suspicious objects, and to walk in front of soldiers as the army surrounds its targets.\n\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20190215131148/https://www.adalah.org/uploads/oldfiles/eng/pressreleases/02_08_18-2.htm\n\nOf course, it‚Äôs no longer called the Neighbor Procedure. Instead, the Palestinians used are referred to as ‚Äùjohnnies ‚Äú. While the Israeli high court banned the procedure, the IDF actually appealed the decision, claiming it was useful and saved lives.\n\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20190215131228/https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3154142,00.html\n\nAlso, they still use it from time to time with no repurcussions.\n\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20190215131321/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/21/israeli-soldiers-human-shield-avoid-jail\n\nThe IDF not only uses kids as shields, but tortures them while they‚Äôre at it, in a revelation that should shock absolutely no one at this point.\n\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20190215131424/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-palestinian-israel-children/palestinian-children-tortured-used-as-shields-by-israel-u-n-idUSBRE95J0FR20130620\n\nAfter the advocacy group Breaking The Silence released a booklet revealing how many times they got away with using Palestinians as shields, Haaretz noted that the reactions from the IDF were rather morbid..\n\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20190215131514/https://www.haaretz.com/1.5078110\n\nIn February 2007, footage was released of an incident involving Sameh Amira, a 24-year-old Palestinian, who video showed serving as a human shield for a group of Israeli soldiers, getting inside apartments suspected to belong to Palestinian militants ahead of the soldiers\n\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20190215131832/https://www.cbsnews.com/news/israel-probes-human-shield-allegations/\n\nIn another incident during a protest in Hebron, to protect themselves from some fucking stones, the IDF deployed, then promptly forgot to stop deploying, the use of human shields.\n\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20190215131905/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/jan/02/israel1\n\nDespite banning the Neighbor Procedure a year before, Israel deployed the use of human shields again in the battle of Jenin.\n\nThe source given above is one of Beit Hanoun, this is for Jenin https://web.archive.org/web/20190215132050/https://www.btselem.org/press_releases/20030514\n\nThey did it again when they invaded Beit Hanoun in 04.\n\nThis is another source - https://web.archive.org/web/20190215132306/https://www.btselem.org/human_shields/20060720_human_shields_in_beit_hanun\n\n¬†\n\n**And regarding the killing of civilians, the United Nations tracks and reports on this:**\n\nFrom Jan. 1, 2008 through Feb. 23, 2020 (12+ YEARS) lists the following totals:\n\nIsraeli civilians killed by Palestinians: 248\n\nPalestinian civilians killed by Israelis: 5,572\n\nLINK: https://www.ochaopt.org/data/casualties\n\nThe Israeli National Road Safety Authority reported that 341 Israelis were killed in traffic accidents on the roads of the country in 2019 ALONE.\n\nLINK: https://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/More-Israelis-killed-in-traffic-accidents-in-2019-than-during-2018-611749\n\nProving conclusively that it is many times more dangerous to drive in Israel than to live near the Palestinians.\n\nWho has been feeding you all the LIES that you believe and spew on the internet?

        "title": "It's important for Pro Palestinians to know the Biblical verses that condemn Israel's crimes against the Palestinians as a way to effectively counter their propaganda.",
        "selftext": "As everyone knows one of the things that is used and weaponised in this conflict is the Bible. The rhetoric basically is \"God has a chosen people, and he gave them this land\" therefore they can kick the Palestinians out of it. As a practising Christian myself I feel an obligation to counter this propaganda. Especially when it is used by the Christian Zionist movement. In counter to this their is an alternative reading of the Bible. One rooted in Liberation theology. In the context of Palestine it is Palestinian Liberation theology that challenges occupation, settler colonialism and the weaponisation of the Bible. It is practised by Palestinian Christians in solidarity with their Muslim brothers and sisters who are catching the same hell. The Reverend Munther Isaac is a perfect example of this. I would like to introduce all who believe in Palestinian solidarity to some of the Biblical verses that promote a liberation understanding of this issue. Here are some examples:\n\n**Prophetic literature:**\n\n* \"Cease to do evil, learn to do good, seek justice, rescue the oppressed, defend the orphan, plead for the widow\"(Isaiah 1:17)\n* \"Is not this the fast that I choose: to loose the bonds of injustice, to undo the thongs of the yoke, to let the oppressed go free and to break every yoke?\"(Isaiah 58:6)\n* \"Their webs cannot serve as clothing; they cannot cover themselves with what they make. Their works are works of iniquity, and deeds of violence are in their hands. Their feet run to evil, and they rush to shed innocent blood; their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity, desolation and destruction are their highways\"(Isaiah 59:6-7)\n* \"Thus says the Lord: Act with justice and righteousness, and deliver from the hand of the oppressor anyone who has been robbed. And do no wrong or violence nor shed innocent blood in this place\"(Jeremiah 22:3)\n* \"The Princes of Israel in you, every one according to his power, have been bent on shedding blood. Father and mother are treated with contempt in you; the alien residing within you suffers extortion, the orphan and the widow are wronged in you...in you are those who **slander to shed blood**...See I strike my hands together at the dishonest gain you have made, and at the blood that has been shed within you\"(Ezekiel 22:6-13)\n* \"The word of the Lord came to me: Mortal, say to it(Jerusalem): You are a land that is not cleansed, not rained upon in the day of indignation. It's princes within it are like a roaring lion tearing the prey; they have devoured human lives; they have taken treasure and precious things; they have made many widows within it. Its priests have done violence to my teachings and have profaned my holy things...Its officials within it are like wolves tearing the prey, shedding blood, destroying lives to get dishonest gain. Its prophets have **smeared whitewash on their behalf, seeing false visions, and divining lies for them, saying 'Thus says the Lord God' when the Lord has not spoken\"** (Ezekiel 22:23-29) \n* \"Thus says the Lord\" For three transgressions(sins) of Israel, and for four I will not revoke the punishment, because they sell the righteous for silver, and the needy for a pair of sandals, they who trample the head of the poor into the dust of the earth and push the afflicted out of the way\"(Amos 2:6-7) \n* \"They hate the one who reproves in the gate(criticises) and they abhor the one who speaks the truth. Therefore because you trample on the poor and take from them the levies of you have built houses of hewn stone, but you shall not live in them; you have planted pleasant vineyards but you shall not drink their wine\"(Amos 5:10-11) \n* \"Hear this you rulers of the house of Jacob and chiefs of the house of Israel, who abhor justice and pervert all equity, who build Zion(Israel) with blood and Jerusalem with wrong!....because of you Zion shall be ploughed as a field; Jerusalem shall become a heap of ruins, and the mountain of the house a wooden height\"(Micah 3:9-12) \n* \"The Lord gave full vent to his wrath; he poured out his hot anger, and kindled a fire in Zion(Israel) that destroyed its foundations. The kings of the earth did not believe, nor did any of the inhabitants of the world, that foe or enemy could enter the gates of Jerusalem. It was for the sins of her prophets and the iniquities of her priests, who shed the blood of the righteous in the midst of her. Blindly they wandered through the streets, so defiled with blood that no one was able to touch their garments. 'Away! Unclean!' people shouted at them; 'Away! Away, Do not touch!'\"(Lamentations 4:11-15) \n\nWhat we get here in the writings of the Biblical prophets is a couple of clear themes. The first is a necessary moral commitment to fight against oppression. The second is the Prophets confronting the leaders of Ancient Israel over the fact that they are practising oppression and shedding innocent blood. The words of the Prophet Ezekiel are particularly powerful when he says they \"slander to shed blood\". Pretty timely given the fact that right now, in Gaza, the defenders of the Israeli government are \"slandering\" to justify the shedding of innocent blood by calling anyone who condemns this a \"antisemite\" or \"terrorist sympathiser\". Ezekiel goes on to not only condemn the shedding of blood by the political leaders of Ancient Israel, but also religious authorities who \"smear whitewash for them\" and say \"thus says the Lord\". Again, very timely when we talk about those figures who \"whitewash\" the crimes of the current Israeli government against the Palestinians. The Prophet Micah condemns the leaders of Israel for \"building Zion\" on blood and injustice. All of this is inconvenient in the Pro Israel narrative that weaponises religion in a cherry picked manner. That says \"God gave them the land\" but fails to mention the part in the story when God passes judgement on them for engaging in injustice and bloodshed. The part in Lamentations where it says \"away, unclean\" is God embarrassing the Israelites before the nations of the world where people shun them because they are seen as being defiled with the blood of the innocent. \n\nLast thing to end this is this. One of the favourite passages of Palestinian Liberation theologians is a passage from 1 Kings 21 where one of the Kings of Israel, Ahab, wanted land from the family of a man name Naboth as well as his Vineyard. Naboth refused to hand over his land, because it was the land of has ancestors handed down. So Ahab's wife devises a cruel plot to weaponise the state religion to bring charges of blasphemy against the man and his family and have him and his family murdered. After they murdered him and his family the King of Israel seizes the land. Because of this crime the Prophet at the time, Elijah, proclaims God's judgement which was revolution and the destruction of the King's dynasty saying \"I will bring disaster on you\". For Palestinian Liberation theologians like Reverend Naim Ateek they draw direct connections with this story, and the current leaders of Israel seizing land and vineyards from Palestinians through a process of criminality and murder. So the narrative needs to be reclaimed here. We cannot allow the defenders of the Israeli government to continue weaponising Biblical text to justify this policy of criminal apartheid, ethnic cleansing, war crimes and oppression when in many places the Biblical texts condemns this. An for those of us who are religious who support Palestinian rights, we need to actively speak out and resist this use of religion to justify settler colonialism and genocide. ",

At that point she generally stops pressing. \n\nChristian Zionists and apologists seem to get hung up on the righteousness of Israel which weeps over into allowing them a blank check, while ignoring or missing the calls to humanity and compassion.

        "selftext": "**The British Council is a global cultural organisation which wields considerable power as an English Language Teaching provider, regulator and research organisation. It also has a role in potentiating UK soft power globallly. I have found extensive links between the organisation and the Israeli military-academic complex. The British Council has expressed its intention to work against the academic boycotts and champion Israeli academia. These institutions are powerhouses for the genocide, making the organisation complicit in Israel's continued war crimes**\n\nPlease see [https://x.com/sloughpsc/status/1798832934067089482](https://x.com/sloughpsc/status/1798832934067089482) for the full report.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSummary\n\nThis report explores the British Council‚Äôs extensive strategic alliances with Israeli organisations which are implicated in Israel‚Äôs war of aggression against the Palestinian people. This includes institutions within Israel‚Äôs academic-military complex. It also details the ways in which the British Council has sought to sabotage¬† the academic boycott.¬†\n\nThe Council‚Äôs commitment to advancing Israel‚Äôs interests, despite its genocidal onslaught on Gaza and the 80 years of occupation and settler-colonial expansion preceding it, is in clear conflict with its claims of operational independence and its stated aim of advancing peace and prosperity.¬† This implicates it in war crimes.¬†\n\nThis should be read as a supplement to¬† Electronic Intifada‚Äôs report, which is essential reading.¬†\n\nThe report explores the following partnerships:\n\n* Birax -The aim of the project is to create¬† ‚Äúclose connection between British and Israeli academic communities and establishments‚Äù.Through this partnership the British Council is implicated in the war crimes of the academic-military complex. It was established in response to the academic boycotts.¬†\n* Charles and Lynn Schusterman foundation - An organisation which funds the Institute for National Security. The INSS ‚Äúprovides policy analysis and recommendations to decision makers, public leaders, and the strategic community, both in Israel and abroad‚Äù.\n* Israel Public Broadcasting - Government-owned public broadcasting corporation. Danielle Weiss ‚ÄòGodmother of the settler movement‚Äô¬† issued a call to ‚Äúresettle Gaza and expel the Palestinians‚Äù on Kan radio¬† stating that ‚Äúno Arab should remain in Gaza‚Äù. She received minimal push back from the interviewer.\n* Wohl Clean Growth Alliance - this is¬† part of the 2030 roadmap for¬† bilateral UK-Israel¬† relations.\n* Weizmann institute - in partnership with Davidson, Weizmann run pre-military training programmes for Israeli high-school graduates.",

Most Holocaust denial either downplays the numbers of the dead or denies the motive.\n\nThat is, they claim the Nazis never intended to kill the Jews from the beginning. The camps were only labor camps to get them out of the way but it wasn‚Äôt about eliminating them. The actual final solution decision was a last minute ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù and desperate response to the war being lost. This is absolute Nazi sympathizer propaganda.\n\nNetanyahu veers into both. The latter, as blatantly as anybody. He straight up claims Hitler didn‚Äôt ever ‚Äòreally‚Äô want to kill all the Jews but was talked into it way late in the war.\n\nHe also denies the mass killings by the einsatzgruppen in Eastern Europe, when the true holocaust went into full but prior to death camps, were part of the plan to exterminate Jews. He straight up denies that, since there was no plan to eliminate the Jews until November of 41, apparently, and he denies the architecture of the final solution being put into place from 1940 or so on.\n\nThis is to fit his narrative that the Jerusalem Mufti was the one who came up with the final solution. That way a Palestinian could be responsible for the final solution.\n\nNonsense, of course. The Mufti was in the SS as a recruiter, and was a Nazi who very openly campaigned for the destruction of Jews. And he did meet with Hitler once. But he had zero impact on Hitler‚Äôs plans. There were some Nazi Palestinians and Arabs just as there were anti fascist Palestinians and anti-Nazi Arabs who ended up in camps or mobile killing squad ditches.\n\nIt‚Äôs worth noting that the Mufti was only masquerading as an observant Muslim. He was never really religious, just a political extremist, and it was the British occupying forces who named the Mufti to his post against the protestations against almost the entire Islamic leadership in Jerusalem at the time.\n\nSo if Palestinians are responsible for that the British are twice responsible. But that doesn‚Äôt fit Netanyahu‚Äôs motives because he isn‚Äôt bombing London on the regular. History is just a tool to people like him, and even the victims of the holocaust aren‚Äôt sacred.\n\nAnyway, your mileage may vary concerning Haaretz reporting, but it‚Äôs definitely far more balanced than something like the Jerusalem Post. So here is Netanyahu‚Äôs holocaust denial and extreme historical revisionism.\n\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.haaretz.com/amp/world-news/.premium-how-netanyahu-became-a-holocaust-revisionist-1.6744462"

Sometimes they paid lip service to him being slightly too authoritarian but they had literal posters of him in training halls and tried to correspond with him directly. The Duche wasn‚Äôt that interested in such an alliance, though.\n\nThe founders of the Irgun viewed an axis power block (obviously they couldn‚Äôt foresee exactly how WWII would break out but they saw something coming,) as more likely to grant them a state then an allied one and so considered themselves as part of that loose coalition. Even during the war and holocaust some of the Irgun continued in this view but some didn‚Äôt.\n\nThe Lehi were more fascist than even the Irgun, and openly supported Hitler until about 1940. It was critical support, sure, but their position was that leaders like Hitler would be most likely to support European Jews being shoved out of Europe and into Palestine, and that such regimes would help the Jewish people see the light about the end of European Jewish life and come to Palestine.\n\nThe Lehi also openly called themselves nationalist socialists, following the Nazis lead ideologically but with a Jewish rather than aryan ethno-state.\n\nAfter 1940, they couldn‚Äôt maintain this belief for obvious reasons and switched their ideology to ‚ÄòNational Bolshevism.‚Äô Also called Strasserism or pejoratively ‚ÄòNazBol,‚Äô it‚Äôs just another form of Nazism except that it‚Äôs antiCapitalist.\n\nThey maintained this position until after the founding of Israel. During the cease fire in 48 there was a brief civil war between the Gurion and Begin camps and Gurion won, so the Lehi and such became terrorist outlaws and eventually folded into Likud. The Irgun was more foundational for Likud, though.\n\nThe Irgun and Lehi were both responsible for their own terror attacks but actually teamed up for many of the worst ones like Dier Yassin."

        "selftext": "I‚Äôve been looking into everything that‚Äôs happened since October 7^(th) and Israel as a whole, and I just wanted to rant about the absolute bullshit I‚Äôve come across. One of the most fascinating things I‚Äôve found about people who defend Israel is their total disconnect from reality. Whenever one of the ministers or officials says something especially spicy (‚ÄúErase Gaza, nothing else will satisfy us‚Äù, ‚ÄúBlow up and flatten everything‚Äù, etc.) and it gets reported on in The Times of Israel, most of the comments are something like ‚ÄúThis man is too extreme, he doesn‚Äôt represent this country‚Äù or ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why this guy is allowed to be in our government‚Äù and it‚Äôs like they don‚Äôt realize that this *is* their government, that their country has been hijacked by the most batshit insane individuals to the point that removing anyone who‚Äôs said something outright racist or genocidal would basically be overthrowing the whole government.\n\nI don‚Äôt know what it is but there‚Äôs something about the Israel-Palestine conflict that completely flips some people‚Äôs brains upside-down and makes them say shit that you couldn‚Äôt imagine being said when defending any other country. ‚ÄúPropaganda isn‚Äôt necessarily a bad thing‚Äù, ‚ÄúI think colonialism gets a bad rap‚Äù, ‚ÄúArmy commanders aren‚Äôt high in rank‚Äù, ‚ÄúNo one gives a shit about the Geneva Conventions‚Äù, ‚ÄúThose dudes waving a white flag were basically asking to get shot‚Äù, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm pro-genocide‚Äù, and my personal favorite, in the middle of an argument on the Israel-Palestine subreddit, someone excusing the genocidal statements the ministers make because Israel is a democracy and then rhetorically asking if I would rather the whole country be one giant hive mind that only has one opinion. Like seriously what the fuck?\n\nAnother way these defenders disconnect from reality is their refusal to look at the actual facts of the matter, because if they did, they would have to admit that Israel has shot people waving white flags multiple times. They would have to admit that the IDF routinely shoots children, that the Gaza Health Ministry‚Äôs death toll is actually reliable and if anything an underestimate, that the IDF has admitted to destroying buildings that have no military value, that the current combatants-to-civilians killed ratio is not ‚Äúhistorically low‚Äù, that soldiers are torturing and sexually abusing prisoners, that Gaza‚Äôs population is starving with no clean water, that spokespeople representing Israel constantly lie through their teeth, that the government is made up of racist, insane, genocidal assholes that would rather fund Hamas than work towards an actual solution to the conflict, that they openly use bots to disseminate hasbara, that they just let Israeli settlers illegally displace Palestinians, that Israel was founded on ethnic cleansing and is currently committing it as we speak, but that wouldn‚Äôt make you a good defender, would it? A country like that doesn‚Äôt sound like one that people would normally jump to defend, does it?\n\nSo rather than accept the blatantly obvious I guess it‚Äôs easier for them to just fall back on a bunch of braindead responses. ‚ÄúKilling civilians isn‚Äôt written IDF policy‚Äù, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you know the people there are homophobic?‚Äù, ‚ÄúActually there *are* no innocents in Gaza‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe whole Middle East hates them!!!‚Äù, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a few bad apples‚Äù, ‚ÄúIf you care so much why don‚Äôt you go there and fight for them?‚Äù, ‚ÄúThey are people of an inferior culture‚Äù, ‚ÄúWar is hell‚Äù, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see you talking about this OTHER conflict‚Äù etc. It‚Äôs gotten to a point where the ICC is straight-up called antisemitic and pro-Hamas for issuing arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant for committing the very war crimes *they openly said they were gonna commit* since the beginning.\n\nIt‚Äôs pretty telling how grave Israel‚Äôs crimes are when merely pointing them out makes you sound like some sort of conspiracy theorist to some people, like how Ta-Nehisi Coates‚Äôs book was called extremist when all he did was visit Israel and describe how he saw Palestinians being treated, or how some officials want to shut down the Breaking The Silence NGO because it has soldiers expose how shitty the IDF really is. Seriously, imagine being such an evil country that just talking about how it operates makes you sound like a lying extremist.\n\nI‚Äôm not exaggerating when I say that defending Israel is a phenomenon that needs to be extensively studied for decades to come once the world sees that country for what it is. I need a good laugh so if anyone‚Äôs heard any other stupid excuses they've heard defenders give, I‚Äôd love to hear them",

If you support the acts of the state of Israel in ignorance or in malice, it's too difficult to have a conversation and meet people where they're at. They adopt the same mask everyone else does. Engage in bad faith, make jokes, make claims that make no sense, make excuses for genocide and whatever else. It's like trying to get your point across to a complete narcissist. That is what the state has embodied and it is what the propaganda has helped make people into. Dehumanizing and rationalizing, being a state sized crybully."

A government who lied in support of Israel only days ago.\n\nFurthermore, if Palestine had rockets this powerful, where are the demolished Israeli buildings? Odd how all the demolished buildings are in Palestine.\n\nIsrael destroyed a school in Gaza earlier the same day. They bombed ambulances after murdering innocents fleeing South on the road they had designated as safe passage. They threatened to bomb the al-Ahli Arab Hospital several times before they did. They have bombed hospitals in the past (source: https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2014/07/israelgaza-attacks-medical-facilities-and-civilians-add-war-crime-allegations/).\n\nYou cannot trust the Israeli government and you cannot trust the American government.\n\nNote: Please ignore any \"What about...\" questions talking about different topics. That is another standard Israeli tactic. This thread is about Israel bombing hospitals.",

        "selftext": "Posted on Facebook. I don't know if it's the author's own work\n\n\n\n\"I am Israel. I never miss a chance to claim victimhood while inflicting violence.\n\nIn 1947, the United Nations handed me more than half of someone else‚Äôs land. A gift I didn‚Äôt earn, from colonial powers who didn‚Äôt own it. I accepted. My neighbors objected. I called it war‚Äîand in the chaos, I began my cleansing. Over 700,000 Palestinians were driven from their homes‚Äîsome fled, yes‚Äîbut many were forced out at gunpoint, their villages razed, their names erased.\n\nThen I planted pine trees over the ruins‚Äîto hide the memory. Forests where homes once stood. Parks over cemeteries. I made it green so the world wouldn‚Äôt see the black underneath. I called it ‚Äúreforestation.‚Äù They called it erasure.\n\nI am Israel. I have never chosen peace‚Äîonly dominance.\n\nIn 1967, I launched a pre-emptive war and seized Gaza, the West Bank, East Jerusalem, the Golan Heights, and Sinai. I claimed it was for security. I held onto it for power. I built settlements, one by one, choking Palestinian towns. International law said it was illegal. I ignored it. My map grew. Their freedom shrank.\n\nI am Israel. I could have ended the occupation. Many times. But I always said no.\n\nIn 2000, at Camp David, I offered a patchwork of disconnected enclaves surrounded by walls, checkpoints, and soldiers. I called it peace. Palestinians walked away. I called them extremists. Then I built a wall, not on my border‚Äîbut deep in theirs. I called it security. They called it theft.\n\nI am Israel. I glorify militarism. I raise children to believe they are chosen.\n\nMy textbooks erase Palestine. My soldiers patrol streets with rifles pointed at teenagers. My media justifies bombings. My politicians joke about flattening Gaza. I send airstrikes to refugee camps, schools, and hospitals. Then I say they were human shields.\n\nI am Israel. I elected Netanyahu. Again and again.\n\nNot once, by mistake. But knowingly. I voted for leaders who vowed to crush the Palestinians, to expand settlements, to never allow a Palestinian state. My ministers speak of ‚Äúthe Arabs‚Äù as a demographic threat. My settlers burn olive trees. My mobs chant ‚ÄúDeath to Arabs.‚Äù I call it patriotism.\n\nI am Israel. I speak of democracy‚Äîbut deny it to millions under my control.\n\nI rule over millions who cannot vote in the country that controls their lives. I build roads they cannot drive on. I issue permits for them to breathe, to move, to live. I bomb Gaza, then seal it off and say it‚Äôs their fault. I say I left Gaza‚Äîbut I control its air, sea, and borders. I say they are free‚Äîthen I starve them.\n\nI am Israel. I demand recognition‚Äîbut give none in return.\n\nI demand that Palestinians accept me as a Jewish state‚Äîwhile refusing to even say the word ‚ÄúNakba.‚Äù I ignore the homes, lands, and history of those I displaced. I hold their keys in museums, not their hands. I deny the refugees their right to return. I make laws that call them ‚Äúabsentees,‚Äù even when they‚Äôre just over the hill.\n\nI am Israel. I cry antisemitism‚Äîwhen what I fear is accountability.\n\nI call any critic a hater. I blur the line between Judaism and Zionism, using one to shield the crimes of the other. I weaponize history to excuse apartheid. I manipulate trauma to justify conquest. I say ‚ÄúNever again‚Äù‚Äîbut let it happen to others, by my own hand.\n\nI am Israel. I will never be secure.\"\n\n---",

Israeli forces are deliberately blocking the delivery of water, food, and fuel, while willfully impeding humanitarian assistance, apparently razing agricultural areas, and depriving the civilian population of objects indispensable to their survival‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIsraeli officials have made public statements expressing their aim to deprive civilians in Gaza of food, water, and fuel ‚Äì statements reflected in Israeli forces‚Äô military operations.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúInternational humanitarian law, or the laws of war, prohibits the starvation of civilians as a method of warfare. The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court provides that intentionally starving civilians by ‚Äúdepriving them of objects indispensable to their survival, including willfully impeding relief supplies‚Äù is a war crime. Criminal intent does not require the attacker‚Äôs admission but can also be inferred from the totality of the circumstances of the military campaign.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIn addition, Israel‚Äôs continuing blockade of Gaza, as well as its more than 16-year closure, amounts to collective punishment of the civilian population, a war crime. As the occupying power in Gaza under the Fourth Geneva Convention, Israel has the duty to ensure that the civilian population gets food and medical supplies.‚Äù\n\nhttps://www.hrw.org/news/2023/12/18/israel-starvation-used-weapon-war-gaza\n\nhttps://www.euronews.com/2023/12/18/report-indicates-starvation-used-as-a-weapon-by-israel-in-gaza-occupation\n\nThoughts: have we heard in the media anyone calling this out ? Starving a whole city is a war crime by definition, but people are still to afraid to speak on it ? \n\nPeople who are protest against Israeli war crimes are called either terror supporters or anti semitics.

The journalist expressed his concern about the kids in Gaza and his response was immediately 'are you seriously asking me about Palestinian civilians right now? What is wrong with you' \n\nAnd that's an Israeli official. On the counter part, a spokesman for the Palestinian government, who lost SIX MEMBERS of his relatives in the recent attacks was asked to condemn hamas RIGHT AFTER acknowledging and establishing that he lost six members of his family. \n\nIt's genocidal maniacs and those who excuse them."
